559ebad3d2c637913a39ec18	2004	adds_modification	Prior to anaphase onset, sister-chromatids are held together by cohesin complexes distributed along chromosomal arms and at centromeres. In prometaphase, PLK1, likely recruited to cohesin complexes by binding to CDK1-phosphorylated CDCA5 (Sororin) (Zhang et al. 2011), phosphorylates cohesin subunits STAG2 (SA2) and RAD21 (Hauf et al. 2005). PLK1-mediated phosphorylation of cohesin subunits at centromeres is counteracted by the phosphatase activity of PP2A complex (containing the regulatory subunit B56 i.e. PPP2R5), which is recruited to the kinetochore by shugoshin proteins, SGOL1 and SGOL2 (Kitajima et al. 2006). Therefore, while cohesin complexes dissociate from chromosomal arms in prometaphase (Hauf et al. 2001), they remain bound to centromeres until anaphase onset (Hauf et al. 2001, Hauf et al. 2005, Kitajima et al. 2006). When separase is activated after its inhibitor securin is degraded by APC/C at the onset of anaphase, RAD21 is cleaved by separase. Phosphorylation of RAD21 by PLK1 facilitates subsequent cleavage of RAD21 by separase (Hauf et al. 2005). There are several potential PLK1 phosphorylation sites in STAG2 and RAD21, but the exact positions of in vivo phosphorylation of STAG2 and RAD21 by PLK1 have not been explicitly established (Hauf et al. 2005).

559ebad4d2c637913a39ffd8	2008	adds_modification	Insulin-containing secretory granules are bound to Myosin Va via Rab27a in a complex of uncertain composition. Myosin Va moves along the cortical actin network (actin at the periphery of the cytoplasm), carrying the granules to the inner surface of the plasma membrane. A beta cell contains about 10 000 secretory granules. Of these, about 1000 are docked at the inner surface of the plasma membrane and a subset of about 100 docked granules form the "readily releasable" pool (granules which are released within about 5 minutes of glucose stimulation). Docking occurs by interaction between EXOC3/Sec6 located on the membrane of the secretory granule and EXOC4/Sec8 located at the plasma membrane. Additional components (EXOC1, EXOC2, EXOC5, EXOC6, EXOC7, EXOC8) form the Exocyst Complex.<br>	MYO5A;INS

559ebad5d2c637913a3a0960	2008	adds_modification	PAK-2p34 is ubiquitinated prior to degradation (Jakobi et al., 2003). Here, ubiquitination of PAK-2p34 is described as occurring in the cytosol. However, to date it is not known whether this occurs in the nucleus or in the cytoplasm. Evidence for this reaction comes from experiments using both human and rabbit proteins. The polyubiquitin synthesized in the reaction is inferred to contain lysine-48 (K48) linkages because the modified protein is targeted to the proteasome (Komander 2009).	Ubiquitin ligase;PAK2

559ebad6d2c637913a3a0b6d	2004	adds_modification	The L13a subunit of the 60s ribosome is phosphorylated about 16 hours after INF gamma induction by an unknown kinase. At this time, L13a is also released from the 60s subunit (Mazumder et al.,2003). It is unclear, however, whether phosphorylation occurs before or after the release of L13a. Here, phosphorylation is shown as occurring after release.	L13a kinase;RL13A

559ebad7d2c637913a3a1444	2006	translocation	The fate of the discontinuous viral DNA duplex synthesized in the cytosol of an infected cell by HIV-1 reverse transcriptase is not entirely clear. Studies of some viral systems suggest that this discontinuous structure is required for passage of the viral duplex DNA into the nucleus while there are evidence contrary to this observation. Studies in vitro indicate that human nuclear flap endonuclease and DNA ligase can remove the flap and seal the plus-strand discontinuity in HIV-1 DNA (Miller et al. 1995; Rausch and Le Grice 2004; Rumbaugh et al. 1998), although role of flap is not yet clear.

559ebb7b7aa7849c3aeb9348	2005	adds_modification	In humans, the IKKs - IkB kinase (IKK) complex serves as the master regulator for the activation of NF-kB by various stimuli. The IKK complex contains two catalytic subunits, IKK alpha and IKK beta associated with a regulatory subunit, NEMO (IKKgamma). The activation of the IKK complex and the NFkB mediated antiviral response are dependent on the phosphorylation of IKK alpha/beta at its activation loop and the ubiquitination of NEMO [Solt et al 2009; Li et al 2002]. NEMO ubiquitination by TRAF6 is required for optimal activation of IKKalpha/beta; it is unclear if NEMO subunit undergoes K63-linked or linear ubiquitination.<p>This basic trimolecular complex is referred to as the IKK complex.

LKB1 phosphorylates AMPK heterotrimer on Thr174 of the alpha 1 subunit (or Thr172 on alpha 2 subunit) leading to activation of AMPK (if cellular AMP/ATP ratio is high) (Hawley SA et al, 2003; Woods A et al, 2003; Shaw RJ et al, 2004). Signals leading to this phosphorylation event can be mediated by exercise, leptin and adiponectin, the hypothalamic-sympathetic nervous system (SNS), and alpha adrenergic receptors, as demonstrated in studies of rat and human skeletal muscle (Minoksohi et al, 2002, Kahn et al, 2005). The details of AMPK activation in response to these stimuli will be annotated in the future. Nuclear AMPK may well be a substrate for LKB1 but, to date, there is no clear evidence for this.	ATP;AAPK2

559ebb967aa7849c3aebbaab	2004	adds_modification	Reactive cellular catabolites can cause DNA damage by 6-O-methylation of guanine. 6-O-methylguanine can pair ambiguously with both C and T, and can cause transition mutations. Active reversal of such damage can be facilitated by proteins having 6-O-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) activity.<p> MGMT removes the methyl group from the guanine and transfers it to the cysteine residue at position 145 on the protein itself. MGMT thus methylated is not regenerated, as the S-methylcysteine is very stable. This is an energetically expensive approach to DNA repair as one entire protein molecule is sacrificed per lesion that is corrected in this manner (Yang et al. 2011).	MGMT;MGMT

The C3(H2O):Bb C3 convertase is sometimes called the initiating convertase, and the C5 convertases also have C3 convertase activity (Rawal & Pangburn 2001).<p>All three pathways merge at the proteolytic cleavage of component C3 by C3 convertases to form two fragments C3b and C3a. The cleavage of component C3 exposes a reactive thioester bond on C3b, leading to the covalent attachment of C3b to glycoproteins on the target cell surface (Law SK et al. 1979; Tack BF et al. 1980). The opsonization with C3b enables the recruitment of phagocytes (Newman SL et al. 1985; Gadjeva M et al. 1998). In addition, C3b anchors the assembly of C3/C5 convertases leading to an amplification of C3 cleavage and effecting C5 activation (Fearon DT 1979; Takata Y et al 1987; Kinoshita T et al. 1988). Moreover, the activation of C3b exposes binding sites for factors B, H and I, properdin, decay accelerating factor (DAF), membrane cofactor protein (MCP), complement receptor 1 (CR1) and microbial molecules such as vaccinia virus complement-control protein and staphylococcal complement inhibitor (SCIN) from Staphylococcus aureus (Forneris F et al. 2010; Morgan HP et al. 2011; Nilsson SC et al. 2010; Lambris JD et al. 1984; Medof ME et al.1984; Barilla-LaBarca ML et al. 2002; Smith BO et al. 2002; Bernet J et al. 2004; Garcia Bl et al. 2010) .

559ebbb37aa7849c3aec47be	2006	translocation	BAMBI (BMP and activin membrane-bound inhibitor) is a transmembrane protein closely related to TGF-beta family receptors type I, but without serine/threonine kinase activity. In Xenopus, BAMBI expression is regulated by BMP4. BAMBI interferes with BMP, activin and TGF-beta receptor complex signaling. BAMBI binds various TGF-beta type I receptors, showing the highest affinity for TGFBR1. BAMBI can also bind TGFBR2 and activin receptor type II (Onichtchouk et al. 1999). BAMBI binds SMAD7, and this interaction involves MH1 and MH2 domains of SMAD7 and the intracellular domain of BAMBI. BAMBI and SMAD7 cooperate in the repression of TGF-beta receptor complex signaling, but BAMBI-mediated recruitment of SMAD7 to activated TGF-beta receptor complex, as BAMBI preferentially binds activated TGFBR1, does not lead to TGFBR1 degradation (Yan et al. 2009). BAMBI may downregulate TGF-beta receptor complex signaling by replacing one TGFBR1 molecule in the TGF-beta receptor heterotetramer (Onichtchouk et al. 1999). Alternatively, BAMBI-mediated recruitment of SMAD7 may compete with binding of SMAD2 and SMAD3 (R-SMADs) to the activated TGF-beta receptor complex, thus interfering with the activation of R-SMADs (Yan et al. 2009).

Of these Y783 and Y1254 are required for activation of PLC-gamma1.

559ebbb37aa7849c3aec4b26	2007	adds_modification	The cytosolic AMPK complex is activated by phosphorylation. LKB1 phosphorylates AMPK heterotrimer on Thr174 of the alpha 1 subunit (or Thr172 on alpha 2 subunit) leading to activation of AMPK (if cellular AMP/ATP ratio is high) (Hawley SA et al, 2003; Woods A et al, 2003; Shaw RJ et al, 2004). Signals leading to this phosphorylation event can be mediated by exercise, leptin and adiponectin, the hypothalamic-sympathetic nervous system (SNS), and alpha adrenergic receptors, as demonstrated in studies of rat and human skeletal muscle (Minoksohi et al, 2002, Kahn et al, 2005). The details of AMPK activation in response to these stimuli will be annotated in the future. Nuclear AMPK may well be a substrate for LKB1 but, to date, there is no clear evidence for this.	AMP;AAPK2

559ebbb47aa7849c3aec51a0	2008	adds_modification	Cystine bonds are formed in Proinsulin-1 between cysteine residues 31 and 96, cysteine residues 43 and 109, and cysteine residues 95 and 100. Ero1-like alpha does not directly catalyze the oxidation of cysteines to cystine. Instead it maintains a suitably oxidizing environment for the reactions to occur . Though Ero1-like alpha can act via specific isomerases such as P4HB/PDI, there is currently no evidence that formation of cystine bonds in insulin requires a specific isomerase. Interestingly, even in beta cells of wild type animals, trace amounts of incorrectly bonded proinsulin can be detected. Thus, the formation of correct cystine bonds may involve a period of bond shuffling.	EROIL-like Proteins;INS

559ebbba7aa7849c3aec9cd1	2006	adds_modification	Extracellular signal-regulated kinase 5 (ERK5) is a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family. ERK5 is twice the size of the ERK1/2, containing a conserved amino terminal kinase domain that is 53% identical to ERK1/2, and a unique carboxyterminal region which contains potential binding sites for signalling molecules such as CRK, PI3 kinase and SRC. The second proline-rich region may interact with actin, targeting the kinase to a specific location in the cell. In contrast to ERK1 and ERK2, which are activated by neurotrophins (NTs), cAMP, and neuronal activity in neurons, ERK5 appears to be activated only by neurotrophins. The small GTPase Rap1 and the MEKK2 or MEKK3 kinases are critical upstream signaling molecules mediating neurotrophin stimulation of ERK5 in neurons. MEKK2 or MEKK3 activate MEK5, which appears to be localised in intracellular vesicles. MEK5 then activates ERK5. Once phosphorylated, ERK5 translocates to the nucleus.	MEK5;MK07

559ebbcd7aa7849c3aeccbeb	2004	adds_modification	It has been shown that Xenopus polo homolog, Plx1, directly phosphorylates and activates Cdc25C, which in turn dephosphorylates and activates Cdc2. This step is critical for the onset of mitosis. Since Plx1-dependent Cdc25C phosphorylation occurs in the absence of Cdc2 activity, it is likely that Plx1 is a triggering kinase, which leads to the activation of Cdc2 and therefore the normal onset of mitosis. In addition to catalytically activating CDC25C, PLK1-mediated phosphorylation also results in the nuclear accumulation of CDC25C (Toyoshima-Morimoto et al. 2002).	PLK1;MPIP3

A Ca2+ dependent opsin phosphatase is also present (Kutuzov & Bennett 1996).

Once dephosphorylated, RHO can once again bind the chromophore 11 cis retinal (11cRAL), in readiness for the next photon response. Arrestin (S-antigen or SAG, Yamaki et al. 1988) binds to and sterically caps MII, preventing PPEF1 from dephosphorylating it.	Ca2+;OPSD

The Src family of tyrosine kinases (more specifically, Src, Lyn, and c-src) has been widely implicated in the phosphorylation of PECAM-1. Conserved tyrosine residues (Tyr663 and Tyr686) within the PECAM-1 cytoplasmic ITIM motif have been shown to become phosphorylated.

RSK family members are unusual among serine/threonine kinases in that they contain two distinct kinase domains, both of which are catalytically functional . The C-terminal kinase domain is believed to be involved in autophosphorylation, a critical step in RSK activation, whereas the N-terminal kinase domain, which is homologous to members of the AGC superfamily of kinases, is responsible for the phosphorylation of all known exogenous substrates of RSK.<br>RSKs can be activated by the ERKs (ERK1, 2, 5) in the cytoplasm as well as in the nucleus, they both have cytoplasmic and nuclear substrates, and they are able to move from nucleus to cytoplasm. Efficient RSK activation by ERKs requires its interaction through a docking site located near the RSK C terminus. The mechanism of RSK activation has been studied mainly with regard to ERK1 and ERK2. RSK activation leads to the phosphorylation of four essential residues Ser239, Ser381, Ser398, and Thr590, and two additional sites, Thr377 and Ser749 (the amino acid numbering refers to RSK1). ERK is thought to play at least two roles in RSK1 activation. First, activated ERK phosphorylates RSK1 on Thr590, and possibly on Thr377 and Ser381, and second, ERK brings RSK1 into close proximity to membrane-associated kinases that may phosphorylate RSK1 on Ser381 and Ser398.<br>Moreover, RSKs and ERK1/2 form a complex that transiently dissociates upon growth factor signalling. Complex dissociation requires phosphorylation of RSK1 serine 749, a growth factor regulated phosphorylation site located near the ERK docking site. Serine 749 is phosphorylated by the N-terminal kinase domain of RSK1 itself. ERK1/2 docking to RSK2 and RSK3 is also regulated in a similar way. The length of RSK activation following growth factor stimulation depends on the duration of the RSK/ERK complex, which, in turn, differs among the different RSK isoforms.

559ebbf27aa7849c3aed424e	2006	adds_modification	Following translocation to the nucleus, ERK1/2 directly phosphorylates key effectors, including the ubiquitous transcription factors ELK1 (Ets like protein 1). At least five residues in the C terminal domain of ELK1 are phosphorylated upon growth factor stimulation. ELK1 can form a ternary complex with the serum response factor (SRF) and consensus sequences, such as serum response elements (SRE), on DNA, thus stimulating transcription of a set of immediate early genes like c fos.

If stimulation of the MAPK pathway is sufficiently sustained, ERK1/2 can dock on an upstream FTYP amino acid motif, called the DEF domain (docking site for ERKs, FXFP), and phosphorylate Thr-331 and Thr-325.</p><p>Phosphorylation at specific sites enhances the transactivating potential of several AP-1 proteins, including Jun and Fos, without having any effect on their DNA binding activities. Thus, phosphorylation of Ser-362 and Ser-374 stabilizes c-Fos but has no demonstrated role in the control of transcriptional activity. On the contrary, phosphorylation of Thr-325 and Thr-331 enhances c-Fos transcriptional activity but has no demonstrated effect on protein turnover.	Phospho-ERK dimer;FOS

559ebbff7aa7849c3aed4bf3	2005	adds_modification	Rat perilipin, the major protein at the surfaces of cytosolic lipid particles in adipocytes and steroidogenic cells (Blanchette-Mackie et al. 1995), is phosphorylated by protein kinase A catalytic subunit (Greenberg et al. 1991) on serine residues 81, 223, and 277 (Tansey et al. 2003). All three serine residues and the adjoining sequences that mediate phosphorylation (Cohen 1988) are conserved in mouse perilipin, while only the first and third are conserved in human perilipin. By inference, PKA targets these three mouse and two human serines as well. Phosphorylated perilipin is redistributed on the droplet surfaces (Souza et al. 1998). While two isoforms of rat perilipin protein are found on lipid particles in adipocytes, only the larger isoform appears to regulate lipolysis (Tansey et al 2003). The single human and mouse isoforms of perilipin correspond to the large rat isoform. In mouse 3T3-L1 cells, perilipin phosphorylation requires the presence of caveolin-1 at the surface of the lipid particle (Cohen et al. 2004). This positive regulatory effect of caveolin-1 is inferred for rat and human.	CAV1;PLIN1

PRAS40 binds to mTOR complexes, mediating AKT signals to mTOR. Interaction of PRAS40 with the mTOR kinase domain is induced under conditions that inhibit mTOR signalling, such as growth factor deprivation. Binding of PRAS40 inhibits mTOR. PRAS40 phosphorylation by AKT and association with the cytosolic anchor protein 14-3-3, lead to mTOR stimulation (Vander Haar E, et al, 2007).

559ebc017aa7849c3aed5f13	2006	adds_modification	AKT phosphorylates and inhibits TSC2 (tuberin), a suppressor of the TOR kinase pathway, which senses nutrient levels in the environment. TSC2 forms a TSC1-TSC2 protein complex that is a GAP (GTPase activating protein) for the RHEB G-protein. RHEB, in turn, activates the TOR kinase. Thus, an active AKT1 activates the TOR kinase, both of which are positive signals for cell growth (an increase in cell mass) and division.<br>The TOR kinase regulates two major processes: translation of selected mRNAs in the cell and autophagy. In the presence of high nutrient levels TOR is active and phosphorylates the 4EBP protein releasing the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), which is essential for cap-dependent initiation of translation and promoting growth of the cell (PMID: 15314020). TOR also phosphorylates the S6 kinase, which is implicated in ribosome biogenesis as well as in the modification of the S6 ribosomal protein. AKT can also activate mTOR by another mechanism, involving phosphorylation of PRAS40, an inhibitor of mTOR activity.	p-AKT;TSC2

Three isoforms of protein kinase A are known, but with no known differences in substrate specificity or tissue specific expression patterns, so a generic PKA (with all three forms as instances) is annotated as the catalyst of this reaction. Other serine residues in HSL can be phosphorylated both in vitro and in vivo, and while these other phosphorylations appear not to affect triacylglycerol hydrolysis by HSL directly, they may affect the efficiency with which serines 659 and 660 themselves are phosphorylated, or affect the efficiency with which HSL is translocated to cytosolic lipid particles (Holm et al. 2000).<p>Phosphorylation of human HSL has not been studied in detail, so the human reaction is inferred from the well-studied rat one. By BLAST alignment, human HSL residues 649 and 650 correspond to rat serines 659 and 660.	PKA catalytic subunit;LIPS

559ebc027aa7849c3aed689b	2005	adds_modification	Rat perilipin, the major protein at the surfaces of cytosolic lipid particles in adipocytes and steroidogenic cells (Blanchette-Mackie et al. 1995), is phosphorylated by protein kinase A catalytic subunit (Greenberg et al. 1991) on serine residues 81, 223, and 277 (Tansey et al. 2003). All three serine residues and the adjoining sequences that mediate phosphorylation (Cohen 1988) are conserved in mouse perilipin, while only the first and third are conserved in human perilipin. By inference, PKA targets these three mouse and two human serines as well. Phosphorylated perilipin is redistributed on the droplet surfaces (Souza et al. 1998). While two isoforms of rat perilipin protein are found on lipid particles in adipocytes, only the larger isoform appears to regulate lipolysis (Tansey et al 2003). The single human and mouse isoforms of perilipin correspond to the large rat isoform. In mouse 3T3-L1 cells, perilipin phosphorylation requires the presence of caveolin-1 at the surface of the lipid particle (Cohen et al. 2004). This positive regulatory effect of caveolin-1 is inferred for rat and human.	PKA catalytic subunit;PLIN1

This phosphorylation inhibits the enzyme's phosphofructokinase (PFK-2) activity while activating its phosphatase activity. As a result, cytosolic levels of Fructose-2,6-bisphosphate (F-2,6-P2) are reduced. F-2,6-P2 in turn is a key positive regulator of the committed step of glycolysis, so the net effect of this phosphorylation event is a reduced rate of glycolysis.	PKA catalytic subunit;F261

559ebc027aa7849c3aed6dd7	2008	translocation	The full length Slit proteins are membrane bound via the extracellular matrix proteins when not bound to Robo receptors. These full length Slits undergo post translational modification and proteolytic processing to generate an N terminal fragment (Slit2 N) and a corresponding C terminal fragment (Slit2 C). Slit 2 is cleaved within the EGF repeats, between EGF5 and EGF6, by unknown proteases. Cleavage of Slit proteins is evolutionarily conserved, although the molecular biological significance is unknown. The N-terminal fragment of Slit2 stimulates growth and branching of dorsal root ganglia (DRG) axons, and this activity is opposed by un-cleaved Slit. The stimulation of axon branching is mediated by Robo receptors. Additional functional differences between the full-length and N-terminal forms have been discovered in their abilities to repel different populations of axons and dendrites. Finally, Slit can attract migrating muscles in the fly, and also human endothelial cells, both via Robo receptors.	Unidentified protease;SLIT2

559ebc027aa7849c3aed7275	2009	adds_modification	Stimulation of platelets with collagen-related peptide leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of SLP-76, an adaptor protein with multiple binding domains (Gross et al. 1999). This may be mediated by Syk , analogous to the role of ZAP-70 in phosphorylating T-cell SLP-76 (Bubeck-Wardenberg et al. 1996). The phosphorylated tyrosine residues provide a binding site for the SH2 domains of downstream signalling proteins like Vav, Itk and ADAP (Jordan et al. 2003). Platelets from mice defective in SLP76 do not connect GPVI engagement with downstream signaling (Clements et al. 1999, Judd et al. 2000). GPVI signaling via SLP-76 does not appear to require LAT or GADS (Judd et al. 2002) suggesting that the mechanism is not identical to that of T-cells.

Results from SLP-76 null mice imply a functional role in GPVI signalling. Platelets from SLP-76 null mice exhibit a marked reduction in spreading and a decrease in whole cell phosphotyrosine levels when adhered to a fibrinogen-coated surface. In vivo reconstitution of SLP-76 by retroviral gene transfer corrects bleeding diathesis and restores normal responses to both collagen and fibrinogen (Judd et al., 2000).	p-SLP-76;PLCG2

A Ca2+ dependent opsin phosphatase is also present (Kutuzov & Bennett 1996). Serine/threonine protein phosphatases with EF hands (PPEF1 and 2) that share homology with Drosophila retinal degeneration C (rdgC) are expressed in retina and may be responsible (Huang & Honkanen 1998), there is no evidence for a physiological role in dephosphorylating rhodopsin. Once dephosphorylated, RHO can once again bind the chromophore 11 cis retinal (11cRAL), in readiness for the next photon response. Arrestin (S-antigen or SAG, Yamaki et al. 1988) binds to and sterically caps MII, preventing PPEF1 from dephosphorylating it.	K+;OPSD
559ebc047aa7849c3aed81ba	2012	removes_modification	Activated rhodopsin (MII aka R*) must be deactivated to terminate the single photon response. Deactivation begins during the rising phase of the single photon response after MII binds rhodopsin kinase (GRK1), a serine/threonine protein kinase (Khani et al. 1996). GRK1 is activated by MII whereupon it phosphorylates MII at multiple serine and threonine sites on its C terminus. There are six serine and threonine residues that can be phosphorylated. Increasing phosphorylation progressively reduces the rate at which MII can activate transducin but full quenching requires the binding of arrestin (S-antigen or SAG, Yamaki et al. 1988) which binds to and sterically caps MII (Burns & Pugh 2010, Korenbrot 2012).<br><br>A substantial fraction of rhodopsin kinase (GRK1) is bound to recoverin (RCVRN) in darkness, when internal Ca2+ levels are high. RCVRN is an EF-hand protein (Murakami et al. 1992) that functions as a myristoyl switch. With Ca2+ bound, the myristoyl group is exposed to attach RCVRN to the membrane. When Ca2+ levels drop with light exposure, Ca2+ dissociates from RCVRN and GRK1 is released. Higher levels of free GRK1 accelerate the phosphorylation and shutoff of photoexcited rhodopsin (MII).<br><br>Certain mutations in GRK1 cause Oguchi type 2 disease, a rare, recessive form of congenital stationary night blindness (https://sph.uth.edu/retnet/).

559ebc067aa7849c3aed9714	2012	adds_modification	Activated rhodopsin (MII aka R*) must be deactivated to terminate the single photon response. Deactivation begins during the rising phase of the single photon response after MII binds rhodopsin kinase (GRK1), a serine/threonine protein kinase (Khani et al. 1996). GRK1 is activated by MII whereupon it phosphorylates MII at multiple serine and threonine sites on its C terminus. There are six serine and threonine residues that can be phosphorylated. Increasing phosphorylation progressively reduces the rate at which MII can activate transducin but full quenching requires the binding of arrestin (S-antigen or SAG, Yamaki et al. 1988) which binds to and sterically caps MII (Burns & Pugh 2010, Korenbrot 2012).<br><br>A substantial fraction of rhodopsin kinase (GRK1) is bound to recoverin (RCVRN) in darkness, when internal Ca2+ levels are high. RCVRN is an EF-hand protein (Murakami et al. 1992) that functions as a myristoyl switch. With Ca2+ bound, the myristoyl group is exposed to attach RCVRN to the membrane. When Ca2+ levels drop with light exposure, Ca2+ dissociates from RCVRN and GRK1 is released. Higher levels of free GRK1 accelerate the phosphorylation and shutoff of photoexcited rhodopsin (MII).<br><br>Certain mutations in GRK1 cause Oguchi type 2 disease, a rare, recessive form of congenital stationary night blindness (https://sph.uth.edu/retnet/).

559ebc077aa7849c3aedac78	2012	adds_modification	Activated rhodopsin (MII aka R*) must be deactivated to terminate the single photon response. Deactivation begins during the rising phase of the single photon response after MII binds rhodopsin kinase (GRK1), a serine/threonine protein kinase (Khani et al. 1996). GRK1 is activated by MII whereupon it phosphorylates MII at multiple serine and threonine sites on its C terminus. There are six serine and threonine residues that can be phosphorylated. Increasing phosphorylation progressively reduces the rate at which MII can activate transducin but full quenching requires the binding of arrestin (S-antigen or SAG, Yamaki et al. 1988) which binds to and sterically caps MII (Burns & Pugh 2010, Korenbrot 2012).<br><br>A substantial fraction of rhodopsin kinase (GRK1) is bound to recoverin (RCVRN) in darkness, when internal Ca2+ levels are high. RCVRN is an EF-hand protein (Murakami et al. 1992) that functions as a myristoyl switch. With Ca2+ bound, the myristoyl group is exposed to attach RCVRN to the membrane. When Ca2+ levels drop with light exposure, Ca2+ dissociates from RCVRN and GRK1 is released. Higher levels of free GRK1 accelerate the phosphorylation and shutoff of photoexcited rhodopsin (MII).<br><br>Certain mutations in GRK1 cause Oguchi type 2 disease, a rare, recessive form of congenital stationary night blindness (https://sph.uth.edu/retnet/).

In polarized epithelial cells, assembly and budding of influenza occurs from the apical plasma membrane (Schmitt, 2004). For efficient assembly, all virion components must accumulate at the budding site, and it is believed that the viral glycoprotein accumulation determines the site of virus assembly and budding (Nayak, 2004). M1 is thought to be the bridge between the envelope glycoproteins and the RNPs for assembly (Schmitt, 2004). M2 is also required, because if it is not present RNPs are not packaged into budding virions (McCown, 2005), however it role is not known.	NEP/NS2;M1

It is released when the glucose level in the blood is low (hypoglycemia), causing the liver to convert stored glycogen into glucose and release it into the bloodstream. The action of glucagon is thus opposite to that of insulin. Glucagon, together with glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and glucagon-like peptide 2 (GLP-2), are peptide hormones encoded by a single common prohormone precursor, proglucagon.The glucagon receptor (Lok S et al, 1994) plays a central role in regulating the level of blood glucose by controlling the rate of hepatic glucose production and insulin secretion.

The non-liganded NRs recruit specific corepressor complexes of the NCOR/SMRT type, to mediate transcriptional repression of the target genes to which they are bound. During signaling, ligand binding to a specific domain in the NR proteins induces a conformational change that results in the exchange of the associated corepressor complex, and its replacement by a specific coactivator complex of either the TRAP/DRIP/Mediator type, or the p160/SRC type. The Mediator coactivator complexes typically nucleate around the MED1 coactivator protein, which is directly bound to the NR transcription factor (reviewed in Freedman, 1999; Malik, 2005).<br><br> A general feature of the NR proteins is that they each contain a specific protein interaction domain (PID), or domains, that mediates the specific binding interactions with the MED1 proteins. In the ligand-bound state, NRs each take part in an NR-MED1 binding reaction to form an NR-MED1 complex. The bound MED1 then functions to nucleate the assembly of additional specific coactivator proteins, depending on the cell and DNA context, such as what specific target gene promoter or enhancer they are bound to, and in what cell type.<br><br> The formation of specific MED1-containing coactivator complexes on specific NR proteins has been well-characterized for a number of the human NR proteins. For example, binding of Vitamin D to the human Vitamin D3 Receptor was found to result in the recruitment of a specific complex of D Receptor Interacting Proteins - the DRIP coactivator complex (Rachez, 1998). Within the DRIP complex, the DRIP205 subunit was later renamed human "MED1", based on sequence similarities with yeast MED1 (reviewed in Bourbon, 2004).<br><br> Similarly, binding of thyroid hormone (TH) to the human TH Receptor (THRA or THRB) was found to result in the recruitment of a specific complex of Thyroid Receptor Associated Proteins - the TRAP coactivator complex (Yuan, 1998). The TRAP220 subunit was later identified to be the Mediator 1 (MED1) homologue (summarized in Bourbon, et al., 2004; Table 1).<br><br> The 48 human NR proteins each contain the PID(s) known to mediate interaction with the human MED1 protein. Direct NR-MED1 protein-protein interactions have been shown for a number of the NR proteins. The MED1-interacting PIDs are conserved in all of the human NRs. Therefore, each of the human NRs is known or expected to interact with MED1 in the appropriate cell context, depending on the cell type, the cell state, and the target gene regulatory region involved.

Nef/Fyn interaction centers on a proline-rich motif (Pro-x-x-Pro), which is implicated in SH3 binding. This domain is partially disordered in the absence of the binding partner; when bound this motif fully adopts a left-handed polyproline type II helix conformation upon complex formation with the Fyn SH3 domain. Within this structure the arginine residue (Arg77) of Nef interacts with Asp 100 of the RT loop within the Fyn SH3 domain, and triggers a hydrogen-bond rearrangement which allows the loop to adapt to complement the Nef surface. The Arg96 residue of the Fyn SH3 domain is specifically accommodated in the same hydrophobic pocket of Nef. The Nef-Fyn complex forms in vivo and may have a crucial role in the T cell perturbating action of Nef by altering T cell receptor signaling.	FYN;myristoylated Nef Protein (UniProt:P04601)

Other ELR-positive chemokines (CXCL1 to CXCL7) can also bind with CXCR2 to cause various effects as described below.<br>CXCL1 (previously known as GRO1 oncogene; NAP-3; MSGA-alpha) (Richmond A et al, 1988) is expressed by neutrophils, macrophages and epithelial cells and possesses neutrophil chemoattractant activity. It is secreted by melanoma cells and is implicated in melanoma pathogenesis. CXCL2 (MIP2-alpha;Gro-beta;Gro-2) (Iida N and Grotendorst GR, 1990; Haskill S et al, 1990) is closely related to CXCL1 (90% amino acid sequence). It is secreted by monocytes and macrophages and attracts polymorphonuclear leukocytes and hematopoietic stem cells. CXCL3 (GRO3; GROg; MIP2-beta) (Haskill S et al, 1990) controls the migration and adhesion of monocytes.<br>CXCL4 (platelet factor 4, PF4) (Poncz M et al, 1987) is released from platelets during aggregation and promotes blood coagulation by neutralization of heparin-like molecules. It is chemotactic for neutrophils, fibroblasts and monocytes. Due to all these roles, CXCL4 is implicated in wound repair and inflammation. CXCL5 (ENA-78) (Walz A et al, 1991) is produced by cells which have been stimulated by interleulin-1 or tumor necrosis factor-alpha. CXCL7 (pro-platelet basic protein, PPBP) (Holt JC et al, 1986) is released from platelets once they are activated. It can stimulate various processes including glucose metabolism, mitogenesis and syntheses of plasminogen activator and extracellular matrix.	CXCR2 ligands;CXCR2

Beta-catenin and p120ctn directly interact with the cadherin molecule through highly conserved regions in the membrane-distal and membrane-proximal domains, respectively, of the cadherin. The interactions with beta-catenin and p120ctn regulate cadherin localization at cell-cell contacts as well as its adhesive activity (Halbleib and Nelson, 2006). The association of beta-catenin and alpha-catenin probably serves to link the cadherin-catenin complex to the F-actin cytoskeleton through the protein ELPIN (Abe and Takeichi, 2008). Independently of its association with the cadherin-catenin complex, alpha-catenin also regulates the bundling and growth of actin filaments at sites of cell-cell contact formation (Drees et al., 2005; Weis and Nelson, 2006).

The N-terminus of PB1 (residues 1-48) interacts with PB2, and amino acids 506-659 in PB1 interact with the PA subunit (Gonzalez, 1996; Perez, 2001). Although monomeric PB1, PB2 and PA, as well as PB1-PB2 and PB1-PA dimers are likely to exist in infected cells, it is believed that most of the polymerase proteins are assembled into the trimeric PB1-PB2-PA complex (Detjen, 1987).

559ebc087aa7849c3aedb9aa	2003	binds	SNAPc binds specifically to the PSE. This binding is mediated in part by an unusual Myb domain within SNAP190 (Mittal et al., 1999; Wong et al., 1998). However, even though a SNAP190 segment consisting of just the Myb domain binds DNA, within the complex the Myb domain is not sufficient for binding. The smallest characterized subassembly of SNAPc subunits that binds specifically to DNA consists of SNAP190 aa 84-505, SNAP43 aa 1-268, and SNAP50 (Ma and Hernandez, 2000). Consistent with the requirement for parts of SNAP190 and SNAP50 for DNA binding, UV cross-linking experiments suggest that both SNAP190 (Yoon et al., 1995) and SNAP50 (Henry et al., 1996) are in close contact with DNA.<p>The binding of SNAPc to the PSE is stabilized by a number of cooperative interactions with other members of the transcription initiation complex including Oct-1, TBP, and Brf2.<p>The binding of SNAPc to the core promoter is stabilized by a direct protein-protein contact with the Oct-1 POU domain.<p>SNAPc does not bind very efficiently to the PSE on its own. It contains a damper of DNA binding that resides within the C-terminal two thirds of SNAP190 and/or SNAP45, because a subcomplex of SNAPc (mini-SNAPc) lacking these sequences binds much more efficiently to DNA than complete SNAPc (Mittal et al., 1999). The damper within SNAPc is deactivated, probably through a conformational change, by a direct protein-protein contact with the Oct-1 POU domain. The transcription initiation complex is illustrated in Figure 6. The protein-protein contact between the Oct-1 POU domain and SNAPc involves a glutamic acid at position 7 within the Oct-1 POUS domain and a lysine at position 900 within SNAP190, which are symbolized in Figure 6 by small triangles (Ford et al., 1998; Hovde et al., 2002; Mittal et al., 1999). The octamer sequence within the DSE and the PSE are separated by more than 150 base pairs, but the direct protein-protein contact is rendered possible by the presence of a positioned nucleosome between the DSE and the PSE, which, as shown in the figure, probably brings into close proximity the Oct-1 POU domain and SNAPc (Stunkel et al., 1997; Zhao et al., 2001).

559ebc097aa7849c3aedbad3	2007	binds	Phospholipid (PL) and triacylglycerol (TG) associate with the apo B-48 polypeptide as it is translated. This process is mediated by MTP (microsomal triacylglycerol transfer protein) in the form of a MTP:PDI (protein disulfide isomerase) heterodimer. MTP in vitro binds small amounts of PL and TG (annotated here as as one molecule of each) and efficiently transfers the bound lipid between membranes (Atzel and Wetterau 1994). In vivo, MTP:PDI directly interacts with apoB-48 polypeptide (Wu et al. 1996), and is thought to transfer lipid from the endoplasmic reticulum membrane to nascent apoB-48. While some of the molecular details of MTP function remain unclear, this function is clearly essential in vivo, as patients who lack MTP cannot produce chylomicrons (e.g., Wetterau et al. 1992; Narcisi et al. 1995).	apoB-48;TAGs

It is synthesized and secreted from endocrine cells in the small intestine. GIP induces insulin secretion, which is primarily stimulated by hyperosmolarity of glucose in the duodenum. Gastric inhibitory polypeptide receptors are found on beta-cells in the pancreas (Volz A et al, 1995).

In humans, three opsins are expressed in cone cells used for colour vision. The opsin 1 gene OPN1MW encodes a protein called green cone photopigment or medium-wave-sensitive opsin (Nathans J et al, 1986). Defects in OPN1MW are the cause of partial colorblindness called deuteranopia (Winderickx J et al, 1992).<br>The opsin 1 gene OPN1LW encodes a protein called red cone photopigment or long-wavelength sensitive opsin (Nathans J et al, 1986). Defects in this gene are the cause of partial colorblindness (protanopia) (Winderickx J et al, 1992). The opsin 1 gene OPN1SW encodes for blue-sensitive opsins (BOP) (Nathans J et al, 1986). A deficiency in function or numbers (or both) of BOP results in a selective deficiency of blue spectral sensitivity. This is called Tritanopia, an autosomal dominant genetic disorder of human vision (Weitz CJ et al, 1992).<br>The human gene OPN3 encodes opsin 3 (encephalopsin, panopsin) (Blackshaw S and Snyder SH, 1999). It is strongly expressed in brain and testis with features of a classical photoreceptive opsin. The human gene OPN5 encodes opsin 5, which is expressed in the eye, brain, testes, and spinal cord (Tarttelin EE et al, 2003).<br>The visual pigment-like receptor peropsin (RRH) is found only in the eye, where it is localized to the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) (Sun H et al, 1997). In the RPE, it is localized to the microvilli that surround the photoreceptor outer segments. It may play a role in RPE physiology, either by detecting light directly or by monitoring the concentration of retinoids or other photoreceptor-derived compounds.<br>The putative RPE-retinal G protein coupled receptor (RGR) (Shen D et al, 1994) covalently binds both all-trans- and 11-cis-retinal after reduction by sodium borohydride. The 32-kDa receptor binds all-trans-retinal preferentially, rather than the 11-cis isomer. Defects in RGR are a cause of autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa (ARRP). RP leads to degeneration of retinal photoreceptor cells (Morimura H et al, 1999).<br>Transducin (also called Gt) is a heterotrimeric G protein that is naturally expressed in vertebrate retina rods and cones and couple with these opsins to mediate the stimulation of cGMP hydrolysis.

In vivo, this process specifically targets synapses at neuromuscular junctions, where toxin association with ganglioside may position it to bind efficiently to SYT1 or 2 when those proteins are exposed at the cell surface by exocytosis (Dong et al. 2003).

Endogenous fatty acids are relatively poor activators. Which ligands are most responsible for PPARG activation in the body has not yet been established. Generally, oxidized fatty acids such as 9(S')-hydroxyoctadeca-10,12-dienoic acid (9(S')-HODE) and 13(S')-HODE are more effective activators than are endogenous fatty acids. The thiazolidinedione (TZD) class of antidiabetic drugs are agonist ligands for PPARG (Lambe and Tugwood 1996).<br>FABP4 delivers ligands to PPARG directly. Binding of activator ligands to PPARG causes loss of corepressors such as SMRT/NCoR2, NCoR1, and HDAC3 and gain of interactions with the basal transcription machinery (Yoo et al. 2006).

The functional adrenomedullin receptor AM1 is composed of the calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor (CGPR) and receptor activity modifying protein 2 (RAMP2) (Kamitani S et al, 1999). AM1 receptor can bind either of these peptide hormones and its activity is mediated by coupling with the G protein alpha s subunit which stimulates adenylyl cyclase and increases intracellular cAMP levels (Aiyar N et al, 2001). The function of the AM2 receptor (formed by the combination of CGPR and RAMP3) is very similar to that of AM1.	ADM/ADM2;Adrenomedullin receptor

559ebc097aa7849c3aedbf9d	2007	binds	The survival of motor neurons (SMN) complex binds to Sm proteins and small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) in the cytoplasm. Sm is part the SMN multiprotein complex that contains Gemins 2 â 7, including the DEAD-box RNA helicase Gemin3. The binding of the SMN complex to the snRNAs depends on the presence of specific, high-affinity (nanomolar) binding domains in the snRNAs. The SMN complex binds the Sm proteins through the Sm domains interaction with the Gemins, the TUDOR domain, and through unique arginine- and glycine-rich (RG) domains found in three of these, SmB, SmD1 and SmD3. The association with RG domains is strongly enhanced by the post-translational symmetric dimethylation of specific arginines in these domains, a process that is carried out by the methylosome (JBP1 or PRMT5) complex.

Its primary effect is to regulate the pH of the duodenal contents via the control of gastric acid secretion and buffering with bicarbonate. These effects are mediated by the SCT receptor (Patel DR et al, 1995). The receptor activity is mediated by coupling to G protein alpha s subunits, which stimulate adenylyl cyclase which increases intracellular cAMP levels (Patel DR et al, 1995).	SCTR;SCT
559ebc097aa7849c3aedbfc2	2009	binds	The parathyroid glands play a role in ion homeostasis by sensing small changes in extracellular Ca2+ ion concentration. These glands express a cell surface receptor, calcium-sensing receptors (CaR) (Garrett JE et al, 1995) that is activated by increases in the concentration of extracellular calcium and by a variety of other cations. CaR serves as the primary physiological regulator of parathyroid hormone secretion. CaR contributes to regulation of systemic calcium homeostasis by activation of Gq- (Kifor O et al, 1997) and Gi-linked (Kifor O et al, 2001) signaling pathways in the parathyroid glands, kidney and intestine.

Several active peptides can be produced by proteolytic processing of the peptide precursor (apelin-36, 31, 28 and 13). APJ is related to the angiotensin receptor (40-50% identity) and couples to G proteins that inhibit adenylate cyclase activity. It is an alternative coreceptor with CD4 for HIV-1 infection.

It binds to both the ICR region of the 5S RNA genes and to 5S RNA to form the 7S storage ribonucleoprotein particle (Pelham and Brown, 1980). Upon TFIIIA binding to the 5S gene, the TFIIIA zinc fingers are aligned over the length of the ICR with the C-terminal zinc fingers in proximity to the 5 end, and the N-terminal zinc fingers in proximity to the 3 end, of the ICR. Zinc fingers 1-3 contact the C block within the ICR and have been reported to contribute most of the binding energy of the full-length protein (Clemens et al., 1992). However, TFIIIA fragments containing zinc fingers 4-9 bind to the A block and intermediate element within the ICR with affinities close to those of the full-length protein.

559ebc097aa7849c3aedc0d5	2004	binds	Different ligands of the MOR receptor can promote MOR phosphorylation, uncoupling, endocytosis or inactivation. For example, the endogenous peptide ligands at the MOR induce rapid desensitization, endocytosis and rapid receptor recycling. By contrast, morphine induces little to no endocytosis, tolerance and dependence. The agonist-dependent phosphorylation of opioid receptors changes the receptor conformation and increases the affinity of the receptors for cytosolic beta-arrestin proteins. This results in an uncoupling of G protein signalling and recruitment of the endocytotic machinery leading to receptor internalization and rapid resensitization. By contrast, PKC phosphorylation by non internalizing opioid ligands (e.g., morphine) cause receptors to remain inactivated in the plasma membrane, leading to signaling desensitization and opioid tolerance. In this case receptors appear to require activity of a phosphatase to be resensitized.	OPRM1;Opioid peptide

The SH2 domain of Hck regulates enzymatic activity indirectly; intramolecular interactions between the SH3 and catalytic domains appear to stabilize an inactive form of the kinase. The HIV-1 Nef protein, which is a high-affinity ligand for the Hck SH3 domain, binds to either the downregulated or activated form of Hck causing a large increase in Hck catalytic activity.

559ebc097aa7849c3aedc24f	2009	binds	c-Src binds to Raf1, the interaction involves the SH2 and SH3 domains of c-Src and requires serine phosphorylation of Raf1. Coexpression of Raf1 and c-Src in Sf9 cells results in c-Src/Raf-1 complexes, tyrosine phosphorylation of Raf-1, and stimulation of Raf-1 kinase activity. Tyr-340 and Tyr-341 were found to be the major tyrosine phosphorylation sites of Raf1 when coexpressed with activated tyrosine kinases. However, the significance of tyrosine phosphorylation under physiological conditions remains unclear, as tyrosine phosphorylation of endogenous Raf-1 following activation has been disputed and may be limited to cells of hematopoietic origin.	p-Y419-SRC-1;RAF1

559ebc097aa7849c3aedc272	2008	binds	There are three well-characterized families of opioid peptides produced by the body: endorphins, enkephalins and dynorphins. Endorphins are processed from the precursor proopiomelanocortin (POMC) (Takahashi H et al, 1981), which can also be processed to yield adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and alpha- and gamma-melanocyte stimulating hormone (MSH). Beta-endorphin (Dragon N et al, 1977) is a 31 amino acid peptide found in neurons of the hypothalamus and pituitary gland. It is released into the blood (from the pituitary gland) and into the spinal cord and brain from hypothalamic neurons during vigourous exercise, excitement and orgasm. Beta-endorphin binds with the highest affinity to the mu-opioid receptor but it also possesses some affinity towards the delta- and kappa-opioid receptors. Once bound, it acts as an analgesic in the body by dulling pain. It does this by breaking down bradykinins which are peptides which accumulate in response to injury. The mu-opioid receptor (MOR) (Wang JB et al, 1994) possesses high affinity for enkephalins and beta-endorphin but low affinity for dynorphins.<br>The enkephalins are endogenous ligands, or specifically endorphins, as they are internally derived and bind to the body's opioid receptors. There are two forms of enkephalin, one containing leucine ("leu"), while the other contains methionine ("met"). The met-enkephalin peptide sequence is coded by the POMC gene whereas leu-enkephalin is coded by both POMC and dynorphin genes. Enkephalins are pentapeptides involved in regulating pain and nociception in the body. Their action is mediated through the delta-opioid receptor (DOR) (Knapp RJ et al, 1994).<br>Dynorphins constitute a class of opioid peptides that arise from the precursor protein prodynorphin. When prodynorphin is cleaved during processing by proprotein convertase 2 (PC2), multiple active peptides are released, amongst which are dynorphin A, dynorphin B, big-dyn and alpha/beta-neoendorphin (Day R et al, 1998). Dynorphins primarily exert their effects through the kappa-opioid receptor (KOR), a G-protein coupled receptor (Simonin F et al, 1995). Two subtypes of KORs have been identified: K1 and K2. Although KOR is the primary receptor for all dynorphins (James IF et al, 1982), the peptides do have some affinity for MOR and DOR.	Opioid ligands;Opioid receptors

559ebc097aa7849c3aedc274	2008	binds	Docking occurs once the synaptic vesicle has moved from the cytoplasm to a region apposed to the plasma membrane. The vesicle is held in close apposition to the plasma membrane by several proteins that bridge the synaptic vesicle to the plasma membrane. Some of these proteins are in the plasma membrane while others are in the synaptic vesicle. Vesicle fusion is preceded by a priming event where molecular interactions between the docked vesicle and the plasma membrane undergo changes. The molecules in the docking and the priming process are known, however, the exact sequence and the precise molecular changes involved in docking and priming are not well dissected. In this reaction the process of docking and priming has been condensed. It is known that Munc18 along with its interactors is critical for membrane docking and fusion events while Munc 13 along with its interacting proteins is central to priming. Munc 13 could act as a positive regulator for the priming recation. Finally the primed fusion complex is clamped in the pre-fusion form by a Complexin. Complexins are Ca2+ independent cytosolic proteins that bind to partly or fully assembled SNARE complexes. Complexins play both a positive and a negative role in the release process.	SNAP25;STX1A

The TAM domain of TIP5 (BAZ2A) binds promoter-associated RNA (pRNA) transcribed from the intergenic spacer region of rDNA. Binding is not sequence-specific but depends on the secondary structure of the RNA. The pRNA bound by TIP5 is required to direct the complex to the main promoter of the rRNA gene possibly by triple helix formation between pRNA and the rDNA. The PHD domain of TIP5 binds histone H4 acetylated at lysine-16. Transcription Termination Factor-I (TTF-I) binds to a promoter-proximal terminator (T0 site) in the rDNA and interacts with the TIP5 subunit of NoRC. NoRC also interacts with the SIN3-HDAC complex, HDAC1, HDAC2, DNMT1, and DNMT3B. DNMT3B interacts with a triple helix formed by pRNA and the rDNA. HDAC1, DNMT1, and DNMT3B have been shown to be required for proper DNA methylation of silenced rRNA gene copies, although the catalytic activity of DNMT3B was not required (Majumder et al. 2006).

559ebc097aa7849c3aedc410	2009	binds	The classical view of G-protein signalling is that the G-protein alpha subunit dissociates from the beta:gamma dimer. Activated G alpha (s) and the beta:gamma dimer then participate in separate signaling cascades. Although G protein dissociation has been contested (e.g. Bassi et al. 1996), recent in vivo experiments have demonstrated that dissociation does occur, though possibly not to completion (Lambert 2008).

It is also abundant in T-cells of the intestine but is lowly expressed in lymph nodes and the spleen. Alternative splicing produces two receptors, called CCR9A and CCR9B, CCR9A containing 12 additional amino acids at its N terminus as compared with CCR9B (Yu CR et al, 2000). The A and B forms of the receptor were expressed at a ratio of approximately 10:1. CCR9 has a specific ligand in CCL25 (Thymus-expressed chemokine, TECK) (Zaballos A et al, 1999) and transduces the signal by intracellular calcium mobilization.	TECK;CCR9

559ebc0a7aa7849c3aedc4bf	2007	binds	The mature ternary influenza viral polymerase complex consists of PB1, PB2, and PA. The N-terminus of PB1 (residues 1-48) interacts with PB2, and amino acids 506-659 in PB1 interact with the PA subunit (Gonzalez, 1996; Perez, 2001). Although monomeric PB1, PB2 and PA, as well as PB1-PB2 and PB1-PA dimers are likely to exist in infected cells, it is believed that most of the polymerase proteins are assembled into the trimeric PB1-PB2-PA complex (Detjen, 1987). Newly synthesized subunits of the polymerase are imported into the nucleus through nuclear localization signals (NLS), which interact with cellular importin family proteins (Jones, 1986; Buolo, 2006). Importin beta-3 (Ran binding protein 5) facilitates nuclear import of PB1 and a PB1-PA dimer (Deng, 2006); coexpression of PA with PB1 was shown to enhance the import of PB1 (Fodor, 2004). A PB1-PB2 dimer has been found to interact with the molecular chaperone heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) to facilitate import (Naito, 2007). The three subunits assembled in the nucleus form a mature ternary polymerase complex that binds viral vRNA or cRNA (Jones, 1986; Buolo, 2006).	PA;PB1
559ebc0a7aa7849c3aedc4c2	2009	binds	Thrombopoietin (TPO) is a primary regulator of megakaryocytopoiesis.

559ebc0a7aa7849c3aedc4eb	2009	binds	RISCs can bind target RNAs that do not exactly match the guide RNA carried by an Argonaute. Binding is especially dependent on base-pairing between the target RNA and the eight 5' nucleotides of the guide RNA (miRNA or siRNA). After binding, Argonaute-1 (AGO1, EIF2C1), AGO3 (EIF2C3), and AGO4 (EIF2C4) are incapable of cleavage in all cases. AGO2 is capable of cleaving the target RNA but not if mismatches exist in the middle of the guide (centered about 10 nucloetides from the 5' end of the guide RNA). In the absence of cleavage the target RNA remains bound by the RISC, which inhibits translation of the target RNA and causes the RNA to enter the decay pathway. In vivo, inhibition of translation requires interaction of AGO with a TNRC6 protein and MOV10.	TNRC6 (GW182);RNA (inexact match)
559ebc0a7aa7849c3aedc4ec	2009	binds	RISCs containing Argonaute-1 (AGO1, EIF2C1), AGO3 (EIF2C3), and AGO4 (EIF2C4) bind to target RNAs by base-pairing between the target RNA and the guide RNA of the RISC. AGO1,3,4 do not possess ribonuclease activity therefore exact matches between the guide and the target do not result in cleavage of the target. Rather, the effect of binding is inhibition of translation followed by decay of the target RNA. Argonaute proteins have been shown to interact with ribosomal proteins and with components of processing bodies (P-bodies) where RNA degradation occurs. Direct interaction between AGO and a TNRC6 protein is required for inhibition of translation and targeting to P-bodies in vivo.	TNRC6 (GW182);Argonaute1,3,4:guide RNA
559ebc0a7aa7849c3aedc4f6	2008	binds	Spherical HDL particles bound to the cell-surface SR-BI receptor are disassembled, with the release of pre-beta HDL (essentially apoA-I lipoprotein with a few molecules of bound lipid) and the cellular uptake of the bulk of the HDL-associated cholesterol, cholesterol esters, phospholipids, and triacylglycerols. The specificity and efficiency of this process has been demonstrated through a variety of studies in tissue culture model systems (Rigotti et al. 2003; Silver and Tall 2001). The process is annotated here as a concerted event occuring at the cell surface but its molecular details remain incompletely defined and it is possible that the HDL particle is internalized while undergoing disassembly.

Tight binding of the antizyme to the ODC monomer forming a heterodimer prevents enzymatic activity. The region of antizyme interacting with ODC is contained in a section involving residues 106â212 in the COOH-terminal half of the antizyme molecule.

559ebc0a7aa7849c3aedc50d	2008	binds	Mammalian CSL Coactivator Complexes: Upon activation of Notch signaling, cleavage of the transmembrane Notch receptor releases the Notch Intracellular Domain (NICD), which translocates to the nucleus, where it binds to CSL and displaces the corepressor complex from CSL (reviewed in Mumm, 2000 and Kovall, 2007). The resulting CSL-NICD "binary complex" then recruits an additional coactivator, Mastermind (Mam), to form a ternary complex. The ternary complex then recruits additional, more general coactivators, such as CREB Binding Protein (CBP), or the related p300 coactivator, and a number of Histone Acetytransferase (HAT) proteins, including GCN5 and PCAF (Fryer, 2002). There is evidence that Mam also can subsequently recruit specific kinases that phosphorylate NICD, to downregulate its function and turn off Notch signaling (Fryer, 2004).	PCAF;RBPJ

Although two nuclear localization signals have been mapped in the NP, an unconventional N-terminal NLS and a bipartite NLS within amino acids 198-216 (Wang, 1997; Neumann, 1997; Ozawa, 2007), the crystal structure of the NP suggests that only the unconventional NLS is exposed and can be used as a functional NLS (Ye, 2006). This unconvenetional NLS interacts with importins alpha-1 and -2 (Cros et al., 2005; Wang et al., 1997; Buolo et al., 2006). The three-dimensional structure of NP has revealed that NP molecules associate as a trimer, interacting through beta-sheets b5, b6, and b7 in the C-terminal domain of the protein; the viral RNA likely wraps around the outside of the complex (Ye, 2006).

All forms show enhanced activity in response to DAG and bind calcium, but the effect of Ca2+ seems to differ between isoforms. CalDAG-GEFI exhibited additive enhancement of Rap1 activation in response to Ca2+ ionophore and phorbol ester (Kawasaki et al. 1998). RasGRP2, an isofom of CalDAG-GEFI with an alternatively spliced N-terminal extension, reported to target it to the plasma membrane, was stimulated by diacylglycerol but inhibited by calcium (Clyde-Smith et al. 2000). CalDAG-GEF II/RasGRP1 was additively stimulated by Ca2+ ionophore and phorbol ester.<br><br>CalDAG-GEFI was found to primarily target Rap1A and inhibit Ras-dependent activation of the Erk/MAP kinase cascade (Kawasaki et al. 1998). RasGRP2 selectively activated N- and Ki-Ras, but not Ha-Ras. It also had Rap1A stimulating activity, but less than CalDAG-GEFI. The difference in substrate specificity seen for these isoforms may be due to their different cellular locations, as prolonged exposure to phorbol esters, or growth in serum, resulted in localization of CalDAG-GEFI to the cell membrane and restoration of Ras exchange activity (Clyde-Smith et al. 2000). CalDAG-GEF II/RasGRP1 targeted Ras proteins rather than Rap (Kawasaki et al. 1998, Ebinu et al. 1998).<br> <br>Mouse platelets that lack CalDAG-GEFI are severely compromised in integrin-dependent aggregation as a consequence of their inability to signal through CalDAG-GEFI to its target, the small GTPase Rap1 (Crittenden et al. 2004)	DAG;Ca2+

PKG1 is present in high concentrations (>0.1 ÂµM) in all smooth muscles, platelets, cerebellum, hippocampus, dorsal root ganglia, neuromuscular endplate, and kidney. PKG1beta is the predominant PKG isoform in platelets. PKG1 is required for the inhibition of platelet activation by NO/cGMP.

When phosphorylation is coupled with an influx of calcium ions, PLA2 becomes stimulated and translocates to the membrane where it releases arachidonic acid (AA) from membrane phospholipids. Calcium does not itself activate cPLA2. cPLA2 contains an N-terminal calcium-dependent phospholipid binding domain (CaLB) which shares homology with C2 domains (plays roles in signal transduction and membrane trafficking) and binds it to the membrane. Arachidonic acid is both a signalling molecule and the precursor for other signalling molecules termed eicosanoids (e.g., prostaglandins, leukotrienes and platelet-activating factor).

Alpha7 isoform X1beta1 binds all LM except LM-332, with a preference for LM-211/221 and LM-511/521, while alpha7X2beta1 variant binds preferentially to LM-111 and LM-211/221. LM-511/521 has the highest affinity ligand for all LM-binding integrins except ofr alpha7 isoform X2beta1, while LM-411 has modest affinities for alpha6beta1 and alpha7 isoform X1beta1 (Nishiuchi et al. 2006 - all human reagents except mouse LM-111). <br><br>The N-terminal globular domains of LMA1 (Colognato-Pyke et al. 1995 - mouse LM, rat alpha1 and beta1 integrins) and alpha-2 chains (Colognato et al. 1997 - mouse LMA1, human LMA2, human integrins) can bind integrins alpha1beta1 and alpha2beta1. The N-terminal globular VI domains of LMA5 and LMA1 can bind integrin subunits alpha3, alpha2, alpha4, alpha6 (not LMA1) and beta1 (Nielsen & Yamada 2001 - using mouse LMA1 and LMA5 against human integrins). The IVa domain (L4a) domain of the LMA5 chain can bind integrin alphaVbeta3 (mouse LMA5, human integrin, Sasaki & Timpl 2001). The short arm of the LM gamma-2 chain has been reported to bind alpha2beta1 integrin (Decline & Rousselle 2001). The N-terminal globular domains of some alpha chains can also bind sulfatides, which may also link the LM molecules to the cell surface. <br><br>The relative importance of these interactions is unclear (Yurchenko & Patton 2009). <br><br>Integrins and dystroglycan indirectly connect the LM network to the actin cytoskeleton.

559ebc0a7aa7849c3aedc6fd	2009	binds	FBXL3 is an F-box type component of a particular SKP/CUL/F-Box E3 ubiquitin ligase. FBXL3 interacts specifically with CRY1 and CRY2 in the cytosol to direct the polyubiquitination of CRY1 and CRY2. It is unknown if FBXL3 requires phosphorylation or other modification of CRY proteins in order to bind and ubiquitinate them. Phosphorylation of CRY by Adenosine monophosphate-dependent kinase increases degradation of CRY, apparently by increasing association of CRY with FBXL3 Polyubiquitination of CRY proteins directs them to the 26S proteasome for degradation.

559ebc0a7aa7849c3aedc6fe	2007	binds	NK cells express adhesion molecules that allow interaction with their tumour targets, promoting their lysis.<p><p>For instance, the activating receptor CD226 is known to be involved in cytotoxic lymphocyte formation, as well as platelet adhesion to the endothelium. The cytoplasmic domain of CD226 contains binding motifs for members of the band 4.1 family of proteins, and for members of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase homolog (MAGUK) family. These proteins connect the CD226 receptor to the cytoskeleton and may promote clustering with LFA-1 integrin (also discussed in this pathway), which is known to participate in CD226's signaling cascade. CD226 plays a role in transendothelial migration, where it facilitates adherence to endothelial cells and migration between cell junctions. <p><p>Nectin-2 binds CD226. It is ubiquitously expressed in cells of various tissues, especially in epithelial cells, neurons and fibroblasts. Like many other nectin and Necl proteins, nectin-2 serves as a viral entry receptor for alpha-herpesviruses including herpes simplex virus (HSV-1 and HSV-2). The other CD226 ligand, Necl-5, was initially identified as a receptor for poliovirus.<p><p>CD96, another ligand for Necl-5, is strongly upregulated in activated NK cells.<p><p>CRTAM is similarly up-regulated, and has been shown to to bind Necl-2, promoting NK cell cytotoxicity towards otherwise poorly immunogenic targets.

559ebc0a7aa7849c3aedc76b	2008	binds	Exocytosis of insulin-zinc granules occurs by the calcium-dependent fusion of the membrane of the secretory granule with the plasma membrane. In general, exocytosis proceeds by formation of a "SNARE pair", a complex between a SNARE-type protein on the granule and a SNARE-type protein on the plasma membrane. (The interaction is between coiled coil domains on each SNARE-type protein.)<p>In the particular case of insulin granules in beta cells, the SNARE protein on the granule is Synaptobrevin2/VAMP2 and the SNARE protein on the plasma membrane is Syntaxin1A in a complex with SNAP-25. Unc18-1 binds Syntaxin1A and thereby prevents association with Synaptobrevin2 until dissociation of Unc18-1. Syntaxin 4 is also involved and binds filamentous actin but its exact role is unknown.<br>Insulin exocytosis occurs in two phases: 1) a rapid release of about 100 of the 1000 docked granules within the first 5 minutes of glucose stimulation and 2) a subsequent slow release over 30 minutes or more due to migration of internal granules to the plasma membrane. Data from knockout mice show that Syntaxin 1A is involved in rapid release but not slow release, whereas Syntaxin 4 is involved in both types of release.<p>Calcium dependence of membrane fusion is conferred by Synaptotagmin V, which binds calcium ions and associates with the Syntaxin1A-Synaptobrevin2 pair. The exact mechanism of Synaptotagmin's action is unknown. The migration of internal granules to the plasma membrane during slow release is also calcium dependent.<p>Microscopically, exocytosis is seen to occur as a "kiss and run" process in which the membrane of the secretory granule fuses transiently with the plasma membrane to form a small pore of about 4 nm between the interior of the granule and the exterior of the cell. Only a portion of the insulin in a granule is secreted after which the pore closes and the vesicle is recaptured back into the cell. Dynamin-1 and NSF may play a role in recapture but the mechanism is not fully known.<p>The major effect of adrenaline and noradrenaline on insulin secretion is the inhibition of exocytosis of pre-existing insulin secretory granules. The inhibition occurs at a "distal site", that is, the effect is most pronounced on granules already near the cytosolic face of the plasma membrane. The effect is caused by the Gi/o alpha:GTP complex but the exact mechanism by which Gi/o alpha:GTP inhibits exocytosis is unknown. On release, the higher pH in the extracellular region favours dissociation of Zn2+ from insulin. The insulin hexamer becomes unstable at this higher pH and it dissociates into the active insulin monomer.	SYT5;SNAP25

559ebc0a7aa7849c3aedc829	2006	binds	hTERC is transcribed as a precursor and is processed at its 3' end to yield a 451 nucleotide RNA (Zaug et al. 1996). The accumulation of hTERC that has undergone this processing event requires a conserved region of sequence termed the box H/ACA motif (Mitchell et al. 1999a). This motif is bound by a complex containing dyskerin, and mutations in dyskerin affect the processing and accumulation of hTERC (Mitchell et al. 1999b; Mitchell and Collins 2000; Fu and Collins 2003). Recent studies of purified, catalytically active telomerase indicate that the minimal structure that has telomerase activity in vitro is a complex of one molecule of hTERC RNA and two each of hTERT and DKC1 (dyskerin) proteins (Cohen et al. 2007). Several additional proteins may associate with this minimal complex and modulate its activity. RUVBL1 (pontin), RUVBL2 (reptin), and TCAB1 (telomere Cajal body protein 1) are found associated with human telomerase RNPs purified from HeLa cells, and activities of these proteins are required for telomerase RNP assembly in vivo (Venteicher et al. 2008, 2009). NHP2 (NOLA2) is likewise associated with telomerase ribonucleoprotein complexes (Pogacic et al. 2000) and homozygosity for NHP2 mutations is associated with telomerase failure (dyskeratosis congenita) in humans (Vuillamy et al. 2008). The exact roles of the additional proteins in the assembly and function of telomerase RNP in vivo remain unclear, however, so they are annotated simply as positively regulating telomerase RNP formation.<br><br><br>The core components hTERC and hTERT undergo trafficking in the cell that may be important for telomerase function. hTERC has been found localized in multiple nuclear structures, including Cajal bodies, nucleoli, and at telomeres (Mitchell et al. 1999a; Jady et al. 2004; Zhu et al. 2004; Jady et al. 2006; Tomlinson et al. 2006). hTERT is also reported localize in Cajal bodies, nucleoli, and to associate with telomeres (Etheridge et al. 2002; Wong et al. 2002; Yang et al. 2002; Zhu et al. 2004; Tomlinson et al. 2006). Some of the factors that regulate trafficking of these two core components of telomerase have been identified, such as nucleolin (Khurts et al. 2004), SMN (Bachand et al. 2002), and 14-3-3 (Seimiya et al. 2000). Cytological studies of HeLa cells suggest that the localization of the telomerase core components can change through the cell-cycle (Jady et al. 2006; Tomlinson et al. 2006). Despite these studies, it is not clear in which compartment hTERT and hTERC assemble to form functional telomerase RNP.<br><br><br>The assembly of telomerase involves the chaperone proteins p23 and Hsp90, which stably associate with telomerase in vitro (Holt et al. 1999; Forsythe et al. 2001; Keppler et al. 2006). A number of other proteins interact with the telomerase RNP, but it is not clear if they play a role in telomerase assembly. Interestingly, assembled human telomerase RNP can multimerize, though the function of multimerization remains unclear (Beattie et al. 2001; Wenz et al. 2001; Arai et al. 2002).

The conserved core region of HIV-1 Nef is essential for the interaction with Lck and is also important for enhanced HIV-1 replication in T-lymphocytes.

CCK is synthesized by I-cells in the small intestine and secreted in the duodenum, causing the release of digestive enzymes and bile from the pancreas and gall-bladder respectively. It also acts as a hunger suppressant. CCK receptors bind CCK. In humans, there are two receptor types, A (Ulrich CD et al, 1993) and B (Pisegna JR et al, 1992). The A type are primarily distributed in the GI tract whereas the B type are primarily in the CNS. In the CNS, type B receptors modulate anxiety, analgesia, arousal, and neuroleptic activity.These receptors mediates the action of CCK by association with G proteins that activate a phosphatidylinositol-calcium second messenger system.

A mutant FGFR1c in which Y766 is replaced by phenylalanine is unable to activate PI hydrolysis and Ca2+ release in response to FGF stimulation. Membrane recruitment of PLC-gamma is also aided by binding of the Pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of this enzyme to PtIns(3,4,5) P3 molecules that are generated in response to PI-3 kinase stimulation. By sequence comparison, Y766 is conserved in all FGFR isoforms, and PLC-gamma signaling is observed, to a greater or lesser extent, downstream of all FGFR receptors upon stimulation with FGFs.

Exactly how Robo3 interferes with Robo1/Robo2 function is not yet clear. One possibility is that one of the Robo3 isoform Robo3A.1 may sequester Robo1 into inactive receptor complexes. Robo3 in mouse and human have two isoforms, Robo3A.1 and Robo3A.2 with different Slit-binding activities. Both isoforms can form heterodimers with Robo1 and Robo2, but Robo3A.1 heterodimers cannot bind Slit, so this isoform may serve to sequester and inactivate Robo1.	Robo1/ Robo2;ROBO3-1

559ebc0a7aa7849c3aedc9b3	2006	binds	BAMBI (BMP and activin membrane-bound inhibitor) is a transmembrane protein closely related to TGF-beta family receptors type I, but without serine/threonine kinase activity. In Xenopus, BAMBI expression is regulated by BMP4. BAMBI interferes with BMP, activin and TGF-beta receptor complex signaling. BAMBI binds various TGF-beta type I receptors, showing the highest affinity for TGFBR1. BAMBI can also bind TGFBR2 and activin receptor type II (Onichtchouk et al. 1999). BAMBI binds SMAD7, and this interaction involves MH1 and MH2 domains of SMAD7 and the intracellular domain of BAMBI. BAMBI and SMAD7 cooperate in the repression of TGF-beta receptor complex signaling, but BAMBI-mediated recruitment of SMAD7 to activated TGF-beta receptor complex, as BAMBI preferentially binds activated TGFBR1, does not lead to TGFBR1 degradation (Yan et al. 2009). BAMBI may downregulate TGF-beta receptor complex signaling by replacing one TGFBR1 molecule in the TGF-beta receptor heterotetramer (Onichtchouk et al. 1999). Alternatively, BAMBI-mediated recruitment of SMAD7 may compete with binding of SMAD2 and SMAD3 (R-SMADs) to the activated TGF-beta receptor complex, thus interfering with the activation of R-SMADs (Yan et al. 2009).

559ebc0a7aa7849c3aedca30	2009	binds	NCAM in the developing brain is highly polysialylated and is referred as the embryonic form of NCAM. Polysialic acid is a developmentally regulated, anti-adhesive glycan with a linear homopolymer of alpha2,8-linked sialic acid units. They are mainly attached to the fifth and sixth N-glycosylation sites of the fifth Ig-like domain of NCAM. Polysialylation of NCAM is catalyzed by two polysialyltransferases, ST8Sia II (STX) and ST8Sia IV (PST), which belong to the family of six genes encoding alpha2,8-sialyltransferases. These enzymes add polysialic acid to NCAM N-glycans until it reaches a certain size (up to 200 sialic acid residues), where neither enzyme can interact with polysialylated N-glycans, and the polymerization of sialic acid is terminated.<br>Due to the structure with its chemical nature, polysialic acid can attenuate the interaction of NCAM with NCAM and other molecules in the same membrane (cis-interaction) or in another cell membrane (trans-interaction). During axonal growth the presence of polysialic acid along axons seems to prevent inappropriate synapse formation.	Glycosylated NCAM1;Polysialic acid

559ebc0a7aa7849c3aedca47	2008	binds	CXCR3 (Loetscher M et al, 1996) is predominantly expressed on T lymphocytes, and on other lymphocytes (some B cells and NK cells). It is highly induced following cell activation. There are three isoforms, CXCR3-A, CXCR3-B and CXCR3-alt. CXCR3 binds to three highly related ligands in mammals, CXCL9, CXCL10 and CXCL11 (Xanthou G et al, 2003). The ligands then elicit their chemoattractant functions. CXCL9 (CMK; monokine induced by gamma-interferon, MIG; SCYB9) is a T cell chemoattractant (Farber JM, 1993). CXCL10 (IP-10) (Booth V et al, 2002) is secreted by monocytes, endothelial cells and fibroblasts in response to gamma-interferon. It can act as a chemoattractant for monocytes, macrophages, T cells, NK cells and dendritic cells, promote T cell adhesion to endothelial cells and inhibit angiogenesis and bone marrow colony formation. CXCL11 (I-TAC,; iIP-9) (Cole KE et al, 1998) is highly expressed in peripheral blood leukocytes, pancreas and liver. It is regulated by interferon and has potent chemoattractant activity for interleukin-2-activated T cells.	CXCR3 ligands;CXCR3

559ebc0a7aa7849c3aedca61	2009	binds	As inferred from mouse cell models, the Nucleolar Remodeling Complex (NoRC) comprises TIP5 (BAZ2A) and the chromatin remodeller SNF2H (SMARCA5). The TAM domain of TIP5 (BAZ2A) binds promoter-associated RNA (pRNA) transcribed from the intergenic spacer region of rDNA. Binding is not sequence-specific but depends on the secondary structure of the RNA. The pRNA bound by TIP5 is required to direct the complex to the main promoter of the rRNA gene possibly by triple helix formation between pRNA and the rDNA. The PHD domain of TIP5 binds histone H4 acetylated at lysine-16. Transcription Termination Factor-I (TTF-I) binds to a promoter-proximal terminator (T0 site) in the rDNA and interacts with the TIP5 subunit of NoRC. NoRC also interacts with the SIN3-HDAC complex, HDAC1, HDAC2, DNMT1, and DNMT3B. DNMT3B interacts with a triple helix formed by pRNA and the rDNA. HDAC1, DNMT1, and DNMT3B have been shown to be required for proper DNA methylation of silenced rRNA gene copies, although the catalytic activity of DNMT3B was not required (Majumder et al. 2006).	pRNA (intergenic rRNA);DNMT3B

Vav is regulated downstream of the thrombin and thrombopoietin receptors (Miyakawa et al. 1997) and integrins, including the major platelet integrin alphaIIbbeta3. Vav family proteins are involved in filopodia and lamellipodia formation; mouse platelets deficient in Vav1 and Vav3 exhibit reduced filopodia and lamellipodia formation during spreading on fibrinogen.

Somatostatin has two active forms produced by alternative cleavage of the single preproprotein and named according to the number of amino acids in the chain; Somatostatin-28 and somatostatin-14. The 5 receptors known to date all couple with pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins to inhibit adenylate cyclase after ligand binding. They were classified according to the dates they were discovered; SSTR1 and 2 (Yamada Y et al, Jan. 1992), SSTR3 (Yamada Y et al, Dec. 1992) and SSTR4 and SSTR5 (Yamada Y et al, Sep. 1993).

Beta-catenin and p120ctn directly interact with the cadherin molecule through highly conserved regions in the membrane-distal and membrane-proximal domains, respectively, of the cadherin. The interactions with beta-catenin and p120ctn regulate cadherin localization at cell-cell contacts as well as its adhesive activity (Halbleib and Nelson, 2006). The association of beta-catenin and alpha-catenin probably serves to link the cadherin-catenin complex to the F-actin cytoskeleton through the protein ELPIN (Abe and Takeichi, 2008).

It is a chemoattractant for T-lymphocytes and monocytes, but not neutrophils. In adult humans it plays an important role in angiogenesis by recruiting endothelial progenitor cells from the bone morrow through a CXCR4-dependent mechanism. CXCR4 (fusin) (Herzog H et al, 1993) is the receptor for CXCL12 and, like CCR5, is utilized by HIV-1 to gain entry into target cells. This receptor has a wide cellular distribution, with expression on most immature and mature hematopoietic cell types and also on vascular endothelial cells and neuronal/nerve cells. CXCR7 (RDC-1) (Infantino S et al, 2006) is expressed in monocytes, basophils and B cells and was originally an orphan receptor.	CXCR4,7;CXCL12

This element is the termination signal for ribosomal gene transcription. Binding of TTF1 mediates the pausing of the elongating transcription complex. TTF1 has a relatively low affinity for purified DNA but binds cooperatively to chromatin. Oligomers of TTF1 interact in trans to bind adjacent intergenic regions and form loops of the rDNA.

MBL monomers associate via their cysteine-rich and collagen-like regions to form homotrimers, and these in turn associate into oligomers. The predominant oligomers found in human serum contain three (MBL-I) or four (MBL-II) homotrimers (Fujita et al. 2004; Teillet et al. 2005). Extracellular MBL oligomers circulate in plasma in complexes with MASP1/2. The carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) of MBL binds carbohydrates with 3- and 4- OH groups in the pyranose ring, such as mannose and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine, in the presence of Ca2+. Such motifs occur on the surfaces of viruses, bacteria, fungi and protozoa. The affinity of any one MBL binding site for a carbohydrate ligand is low, but interaction between multiple binding sites on an MBL oligomer and a repetitive carbohydrate motif on a target surface allow high-avidity binding. The specificity of the MBL binding site (it does not bind glucose or sialic acid) and the requirement for a repeated target motif may account for the failure of MBL to bind human glycoproteins under normal conditions (Petersen et al. 2001). This reaction in particular represents the interaction of MBL with bacterial mannose repeats.	Ca2+;Bacterial mannose-based carbohydrate surface pattern

In addition, Smo appears to be involved in homeostasis; deregulated Smo signaling is implicated in tumorogenesis (Ruiz-Gomez, 2007). <br> <br> The ligand of the 12 transmembrane-domain receptor Patched (Ptc) is Hedgehog(HH) but in the absence of HH, Ptc binds Smo (Stone et al. 1996) which consequently becomes internalised into endosomes, where it associates with Costal-2 (Cos2), and lysosomes, where it is degraded. This 'inactivates' Smo by preventing the formation of an active Smo signaling complex at the plasma membrane. Internalised Smo:Cos2 forms a complex with protein kinase A (PKA), casein kinase I (CKI) glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3) and Cucurbitus interruptus (Ci), a transcriptional regulator, enabling phosphorylation of Ci and subsequent processing to a transcriptional repressor form (CiR). When HH binds to Ptc, it does not bind Smo, allowing Smo to undergo a conformational change, exposing a new surface in its cytoplasmic tail. This causes PKA, CKI and GSK3 to dissociate from Smo:Cos2 complexes, so that Ci is no longer phosphorylated or processed to CiR. Accumulating Smo is phosphorylated instead and assumes a third conformational state. Phosphorylated Smo trafficks to the plasma membrane (Denef et al. 2000) and assembles into a signalling complex that promotes the phosphorylation of Fused (Fu) and Cos2. Phosphorylated Cos2 dissociates from membranes and recruits Fu to Sufu (Suppressor of Fused), which produces the activated form of Ci (CiA), probably through phosphorylation of Sufu (Hooper & Scott, 2005).

CD94/NKG2A receptors continuously recycle from the cell surface through endosomal compartments and back again in a process that requires energy and the cytoskeleton. This steady state process appears to be largely unaffected by exposure to ligand.	CD94;KLRC1
559ebc0b7aa7849c3aedcccd	2009	binds	As inferred from mouse cell models, the Nucleolar Remodeling Complex (NoRC) comprises TIP5 (BAZ2A) and the chromatin remodeller SNF2H (SMARCA5). The TAM domain of TIP5 (BAZ2A) binds promoter-associated RNA (pRNA) transcribed from the intergenic spacer region of rDNA. Binding is not sequence-specific but depends on the secondary structure of the RNA. The pRNA bound by TIP5 is required to direct the complex to the main promoter of the rRNA gene possibly by triple helix formation between pRNA and the rDNA. The PHD domain of TIP5 binds histone H4 acetylated at lysine-16. Transcription Termination Factor-I (TTF-I) binds to a promoter-proximal terminator (T0 site) in the rDNA and interacts with the TIP5 subunit of NoRC. NoRC also interacts with the SIN3-HDAC complex, HDAC1, HDAC2, DNMT1, and DNMT3B. DNMT3B interacts with a triple helix formed by pRNA and the rDNA. HDAC1, DNMT1, and DNMT3B have been shown to be required for proper DNA methylation of silenced rRNA gene copies, although the catalytic activity of DNMT3B was not required (Majumder et al. 2006).

559ebc0b7aa7849c3aedcd12	2008	binds	The overall shape of integrins is that of a globular 'head' supported by two rod like legs. The ligand-binding pocket is formed by the combination of A-domain or beta-I domain on the beta3 subunit and the putative beta-propeller fold on the alphaIIb subunit in the head regions. The binding of ligand to integrin is also dependent on divalent cations (usually Mn++ or Mg++or Ca++). A conserved motif, the metal ion-dependant adhesion site (MIDAS) is located in the alpha and the beta chains that coordinate the divalent cation at the top of the domain. <br>Active integrin alphaIIb beta3 interacts with a variety of plasma proteins such as fibrinogen, vWF, thrombin, thrombospondin, and fibronectin. The ability of alphaIIbbeta3 to bind fibrinogen plays a crucial role in platelet aggregation and hemostasis. Most of these matrix proteins have integrin binding sites of 3-6 amino acids length, of which the best known are the 'RGD' and 'KGD' motifs. The alpha and beta integrin subunits are both required for ligand binding.	Integrin alphaIIb beta3 ECM ligands;Integrin binding divalent cations

Induced MEKK1 can activate both IKK alpha and IKK beta thus leading to induction of NF-kappa-B activation. MEKK1 was also shown to induce ERK1/2 and JNK activation [Yujiri T et al 1998].<p>Although TRAF6 interacts with several upstream mediators (IRAK1, IRAK2, TRIF), there is no data showing MEKK1 participating in the interaction with the TRAF6 activators. Therefore this reaction is simplified to include only TRAF6 and MEKK1.	MEKK1;TRAF6
559ebc0b7aa7849c3aedce28	2009	binds	Luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH, also termed gonadotropin releasing hormone GnRH), is a decapeptide involved in the control of human reproduction. There are two genes, LHRH I and II which encode two hormones (Seeburg PH and Adelman JP, 1984; White RB et al, 1998). They are produced by hypothalamic neurones and mediates the release of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) from gonadotropic cells in the anterior pituitary. Their effects are mediated by binding to the gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptors 1 and 2 (GnRHR) (Kakar SS et al, 1992; Faurholm B et al, 2001) which couple with the G protein alpha-q/11 subunit.

It may play a role in instinctive behaviours and emotions. Its natural ligand is nociceptin (orphanin FQ) (Mollereau C et al, 1996), a 17 amino acid neuropeptide which acts as a potent anti-analgesic. Both receptor and ligand are widely expressed in the CNS.

559ebc0b7aa7849c3aedce64	2007	binds	MerTK appears to be required for ingestion of apoptotic cells by professional phagocytes such as monocytes/macrophages, retinal pigment epithelial cells and dendritic cells. Mer appears to be able to induce the cytoskeletal remodelling that is required for engulfment during phagocytosis. For instance, a deletion in the MERTK gene was identified as the underlying cause for retinal dystrophy which involves an impairment in the ingestion of shed photoreceptor cell fragments by retinal pigment epithelial cells. <p> The biological ligands for MerTK are two highly similar vitamin K-dependent proteins, Gas6 and protein S (PS), a negative regulator of blood coagulation. Both proteins are composed an N-terminal region containing multiple post-translationally modified gamma-carboxyglutamic acid residues (Gla). The Gla region possesses the ability to interact in a conformationally specific manner with negatively charged membrane phospholipids, which is thought to mediate the binding of both Gas6 and PS to apoptotic cells. In this way, they are thought to act as recognition bridges between apoptotic cells and the phagocyte cell that ingest them.	MERTK;MERTK ligands
559ebc0b7aa7849c3aedce65	2009	binds	The Rho GTPases, Cdc42 and Rac1, play critical roles in cell migration by integrating cell-substrate adhesion and actin polymerization. PARVB/affixin appears to participate in the activation of Rac and Cdc42 by associating with alpha PIX through its CH1 domain (Mishima et al., 2004; Rosenberger et al., 2005). This activity of PARVB/affixin could promote the polymerization of actin through the activation of downstream effectors of Rac1/Cdc42, including WASP-Arp2/3 and Mena/VASP. Alpha-PIX, ILK and PARVB can be found at the leading edge of spreading cells (Rosenberger et al., 2005 ), and it is likely that activation of Rac1 and Cdc42 at the lamellipodia in some cells is stimulated by interactions of aPIX with PARVB and regulated by interaction of ILK and PARVB (see Sepulveda and Wu, 2005 ).

559ebc0b7aa7849c3aedce89	2009	binds	5-HT1 receptors, once bound to serotonin (5-HT), act on the CNS where they induce neuronal and presynaptic inhibition and behavioural effects. In humans, there are five subtypes of the 5-HT1 receptor, designated 1A-1F (there is no 1C type) (Stam NJ et al, 1992; Hamblin MW et al, 1992; Weinshank RL et al, 1992; Zgombick JM et al, 1992; Adham N et al, 1993). 5-HT5A is expressed in human brain (Rees S et al, 1994) and has an inhibitory effect like 5-HT1 receptors. Both these subtypes mediate their actions by coupling with the G protein alpha-i/o subtype (Lin SL et al, 2002; Francken BJ et al, 1998), inhibiting adenylate cyclase activity and thus decreasing celular cAMP levels.	5-HT1A-F/5 receptor;5HT

559ebc0b7aa7849c3aedcec8	2006	binds	Concomitant with the completion of reverse transcription, the pre-integration complex is formed by shedding of some viral proteins from the viral core, and binding of cellular proteins, thereby yielding complexes capable of integration. The terminal cleavage reaction takes place in the cytoplasm, where two nucleotides are removed from each viral DNA 3' end. This serves to remove heterogeneous extra bases from the viral DNA ends occasionally added by reverse transcription, thereby yielding a homogeneous substrate for downstream steps, and also serves to stablilize the PIC. The DNA in PICs is considerably compacted relative to its length when fully extended, probably due to binding of proteins in addition to the viral integrase. These proteins are not fully clarified, due to the difficulty of biochemical analysis of small amounts of material, but candidates include the viral NC and MA proteins, and the cellular HMGA, BAF, and PSIP1/LEDGF/p75 proteins. Purified integrase is capable of carrying out the terminal cleavage and initial strand transfer reactions.	PSIP1;BANF1

While adipocyte differentiation can proceed without Cebpa, adipocytes differentiated from Cebpa-knockout cells are insulin insensitive due to a defect in Glut4 (Slc2a4) vesicle trafficking.	CEBPA;PPARG
559ebc397aa7849c3af16d17	2008	increases	The INS1 gene, encoding insulin precursor protein, is transcribed and its mRNA is translated on membrane-associated ribosomes.

PDX1 transcription is positively regulated by the activities of the FOXA2, MAFA, and PAX6 transcription factors. It is negatively regulated by FOXO1A, so events that deplete the nucleoplasmic pool of FOXO1A increase expression of PDX1. These events and interactions have not been studied directly in humans, but are inferred from corresponding ones worked out in the mouse.	MAFA;PDX1

In mouse Pdx-1 also increases the number of GIP-producing K cells. Consensus binding sites for other transcription factors such as AP-1, AP-2, and Sp1 have been identified in the promoter of the GIP gene but their role is unknown. The human GIP promoter is responsive to cAMP by an unknown mechanism.	ISL1;GIP

These three factors activate transcription after initial stimulation of adipocyte differentiation but then are replaced by CEBPA within 10 days. CEBPA and other factors may be responsible for long term maintenance of PPARG expression and the differentiated state.<br>Pre-adipose tissue contains both the widely expressed PPARG isoform 1 mRNA and the more tissue-specific PPARG isoform 2. The PPARG isoform 2 mRNA is translated to yield PPARG isoform 2 protein, which has 505 amino acid residues (57 KDa) and is the longest of the 4 observed variants. Isoform 2 is specific to preadipose and adipose tissue (Mukherjee et al. 1997). Confusingly, the longest variant is called isoform 1 in some publications.	CEBPD;PPARG
559ebc417aa7849c3af22066	2008	increases	The HNF4A gene is transcribed from either of two promoters, P1 and P2, the resulting mRNA is translated, and the protein products localize in the nucleoplasm. Transcription is positively regulated by HNF1A. Many of the molecular details of these events have not been studied experimentally in humans, but are inferred from mouse model systems (Boj et al. 2001). Transcription in mouse and human pancreatic beta cells is P2-dependent and in humans yields three isoforms of mature HNF4A protein. A point mutation in the human P2 genomic DNA sequence is associated with MODY (maturity onset diabetes of the young), consistent with the hypothesis that P2-mediated transcription is essential for HNF4A expression and normal beta cell function (Hansen et al. 2002).
