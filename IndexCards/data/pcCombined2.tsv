This conformational change exposes the S2 site in the extracellular region of NOTCH1 and results in cleavage of NOTCH1 by ADAM10 metalloprotease, the mammalian homolog of Kuzbanian (Pan and Rubin, 1997), generating the membrane-anchored NOTCH1 fragment NEXT1.This model is supported by the crystal structure of human NOTCH2 negative regulatory region, showing that NOTCH adopts an autoinhibited conformation where extensive interdomain interactions within the negative regulatory region bury S2.

LPS binds to the hydrophobic pocket of MD-2 and directly mediates the dimerization of the two TLR4:MD-2 complexes in a symmetrical manner. Both hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions contribute to the main dimerization interaction between MD-2, LPS and TLR4 multimer components. The phosphate groups of LPS also contribute to the receptor multimerization by forming ionic interactions with positively charged residues of TLR4 and MD-2. (Park BS et al, 2009). </p><p>The activated TLR4 receptor is composed of two copies of the TLR4-MD2-LPS complex and initiates signal transduction by recruiting intracellular adaptor molecules."

RAB6A;NOTC42007	8	translocation	"Alpha5beta1 integrin was the first integrin shown to bind fibronectin (FN1). Unlike other FN1-binding integrins it is a specialist at this task. In solution FN1 occurs as a dimer. Binding to alpha5beta1 integrin stimulates FN1 self-association; blocking the RGD-cell binding domain of FN1 blocks fibril formation (Fogerty et al. 1990). FN1 binding is believed to induce integrin clustering, which promotes FN1-FN1 interactions. Integrin clustering is mediated by association between integrins and intracellular actin stress fibers (Calderwood et al. 2000). Binding of integrins to each of the monomers in the FN1 dimer pair is thought to trigger a conformational change in FN1 that exposes 'cryptic' FN1 binding sites that allow additional fibronectin dimers to bind without the requirement for pre-association with integrins (Singh et al. 2010). This non-covalent interaction may involve interactions with fibrillin (Ohashi & Erickson 2009). I1-5 functions as a unit that is the primary FN matrix assembly domain (Sottile et al. 1991) but other units are likely to be involved (Singh et al. 2010). Other integrins able to bind FN1 include alphaIIbBeta3, which is highly expressed on platelets where it predominantly binds fibrinogen leading to thrombus formation but also binds FN1 (Savage et al. 1996). Alpha4beta1 mediates cell-cell contacts and cell-matrix contacts through the ligands VCAM-1 and FN1, respectively (Humphries et al. 1995). Integrins alpha3beta1, alpha4beta7, alphaVbeta1, 3 (Johansson et al. 1997), 6 (Busk et al. 1992) and alpha8beta1 (Muller et al. 1995, Farias et al. 2005) are all able to bind FN1. <br><br>Tenacious binding of free fibronectin to cells leads to enhanced fibronectin matrix assembly and the formation of a polymerized fibronectin ""cocoon"" around the cells.

GTP__G-protein alpha (q/11);MK142008	8	adds_modification	"TRAF6 possesses ubiquitin ligase activity and undergoes K-63-linked auto-ubiquitination after its oligomerization. In the first step, ubiquitin is activated by an E1 ubiquitin activating enzyme. The activated ubiquitin is transferred to a E2 conjugating enzyme (a heterodimer of proteins Ubc13 and Uev1A) forming the E2-Ub thioester. Finally, in the presence of ubiquitin-protein ligase E3 (TRAF6, a RING-domain E3), ubiquitin is attached to the target protein (TRAF6 on residue Lysine 124) through an isopeptide bond between the C-terminus of ubiquitin and the epsilon-amino group of a lysine residue in the target protein. In contrast to K-48-linked ubiquitination that leads to the proteosomal degradation of the target protein, K-63-linked polyubiquitin chains act as a scaffold to assemble protein kinase complexes and mediate their activation through proteosome-independent mechanisms. This K63 polyubiquitinated TRAF6 activates the TAK1 kinase complex."

Lipid-modifying enzymes such as endophilin are also involved in vesicle formation. Endophilin is an acyltransferase that interacts with dynamin and that generates lysophosphatidic acid.

Ser(P) STAT3 was localized to the cytoplasm, nuclei, and growth cones of neurites. Although the mechanisms by which STAT3 is activated by neurotrophins remaines unknown, phosphorylation of STAT3 at serine 727 might function as a convergent point for several signaling pathways triggered by Trk activation.

Sty-1 promotes the membrane fusion between the synaptic vesicle and the plasma membrane by Ca2+ dependant induction of membrane curvature. Synaptotagmin competes with SNARE complex binding in a Ca2+ dependent manner thereby displacing complexin-1 and causing membrane curvature and fusion of the synaptic vesicle with the plasma membrane.

Sty-1 promotes the membrane fusion between the synaptic vesicle and the plasma membrane by Ca2+ dependant induction of membrane curvature. Synaptotagmin competes with SNARE complex binding in a Ca2+ dependent manner thereby displacing complexin-1 and causing membrane curvature and fusion of the synaptic vesicle with the plasma membrane. The fusion is characterized by the formation of a trans SNARE complex in which SNAP 25, syntaxin and synaptobrevin along with VGLUT1, the glutamate transporter, synaptotagmin, and Rab3a either become a part of the plasma membrane or membrane delimited in the vesicular membrane. Vesicle fusion ultimately results in the release of the glutamate into the synaptic cleft."

Ca2+ influx initiates a cascade of events in which the Ca2+ sensing protein, synaptotagmin-1 (sty-1) is central. Sty-1 promotes the membrane fusion between the synaptic vesicle and the plasma membrane by Ca2+ dependant induction of membrane curvature. Synaptotagmin competes with SNARE complex binding in a Ca2+ dependent manner thereby displacing complexin-1 and causing membrane curvature and fusion of the synaptic vesicle with the plasma membrane. The fusion is characterized by the formation of a trans SNARE complex in which SNAP 25, syntaxin and synaptobrevin along with VGLUT1, the glutamate transporter, synaptotagmin, and Rab3a either become a part of the plasma membrane or membrane delimited in the vesicular membrane.

SEL1L;NOTC42006	8	adds_modification	"Chk1 is a checkpoint kinase activated during genotoxic stress. Like ATR, Chk1 is essential for viability in mammals. Targeted gene disruption in mice shows that loss of Chk1 causes peri-implantation embryonic lethality. Even though ATR-ATRIP not bound to ssDNA can phosphorylate Chk1, Chk1 activation is greatly enhanced when recruited to stalled replication forks by physical interaction with a modified form of claspin and the Rad9-Hus1-Rad1 sliding clamp. Activation of Chk1 occurs following phosphorylation of two sites (serine 317 and serine 345). Mutational analysis indicates that modification of both sites is essential for maximal kinase activity, while phosphorylation of only a single site causes only weak activation of Chk1. Following phosphorylation, Chk1 can diffuse away from the complex to further amplify the checkpoint signal. ATR appears to be the primary kinase activating Chk1 as conditions that activate ATR (ultraviolet irradiation or treatment with hydroxyurea) also activate Chk1. Stresses that activate ATM, e.g., ionizing irradiation, do not cause significant Chk1 activation. While the ATR and ATM pathways are distinct, there is interplay between the two. For example, double-strand DNA breaks can be processed in an ATM-dependent manner to generate structures that can cause ATR and hence Chk1 activation. The ATR and ATM pathways also have mechanistic similarities. Analogous to the Chk1 kinase existing downstream of ATR, the Chk2 checkpoint kinase is modified and activated by ATM. Although having distinct structures, Chk1 and Chk2 also have overlapping targets with some substrate sites phosphorylatable by both kinases (e.g., serine 20 of p53)."	ATRIP__ATR;CHK12006	8	adds_modification	"Claspin is a replication fork-associated protein important for Chk1 activation. Claspin loads onto the fork during replication origin firing and travels with the fork during DNA synthesis. Upon fork uncoupling and ATR-ATRIP binding to persistent ssDNA, the activated ATR kinase phosphorylates claspin at two primary sites. Modification increases the affinity of claspin for Chk1. Studies of human or Xenopus claspin indicate that phosphorylation of both sites is essential for significant claspin-Chk1 association. Following claspin modification by ATR, Chk1 can be transiently recruited to the stalled replication fork for subsequent phosphorylation and activation by ATR. Activation of Chk1 allows modification of additional downstream targets, thus amplifying the checkpoint signal. While much of the mechanistic information concerning claspin action has been obtained using Xenopus laevis egg extracts and Xenopus claspin, factors with similar activity have been found in various eukaryotic species including S. cerevisiae (MRC1), S. pombe (mrc1), and humans.<p>Activated ATR phosphorylates human claspin on two sites, threonine 916 and serine 945."

The activated ubiquitin is transferred to a E2 conjugating enzyme (a heterodimer of proteins Ubc13 and Uev1A) forming the E2-Ub thioester. Finally, in the presence of ubiquitin-protein ligase E3 (TRAF6, a RING-domain E3), ubiquitin is attached to the target protein (TRAF6 on residue Lysine 124) through an isopeptide bond between the C-terminus of ubiquitin and the epsilon-amino group of a lysine residue in the target protein. In contrast to K-48-linked ubiquitination that leads to the proteosomal degradation of the target protein, K-63-linked polyubiquitin chains act as a scaffold to assemble protein kinase complexes and mediate their activation through proteosome-independent mechanisms.

Finally, in the presence of ubiquitin-protein ligase E3 (TRAF6, a RING-domain E3), ubiquitin is attached to the target protein (TRAF6 on residue Lysine 124) through an isopeptide bond between the C-terminus of ubiquitin and the epsilon-amino group of a lysine residue in the target protein. In contrast to K-48-linked ubiquitination that leads to the proteosomal degradation of the target protein, K-63-linked polyubiquitin chains act as a scaffold to assemble protein kinase complexes and mediate their activation through proteosome-independent mechanisms.

Though it is now known that other proteins such as C1q and elastin also contain 4-Hyp, collagen is by far the major source (Adams & Frank 1980). 4-Hyp is required for collagen stability at physiological temperatures. The abundance of Hyp in animal proteins is ~4%, making it more abundant than the amino-acids Cys, Gln, His, Met, Phe, Trp and Tyr (McCaldon & Argos 1988). In collagen Hyp abundance is much higher at ~38% (Ramshaw et al. 1998). Full collagen proline hydroxylation significantly raises the melting temperature (Tm) by stabilizing the collagen triple helix (Berg & Prockop 1973a), a process that has been studied extensively using synthetic collagen peptides (Sakakibara et al. 1973, Holmgren et al. 1998) and is well understood at the structural level (Shoulders & Raines 2009). Collagen 4-Hyp content is relatively stable, with small differences between collagen types. Collagen type I has approximately 1 4-Hyp for every 10 residues, roughly 50% of available prolines (Kivirikko et al. 1992). Conversion of Pro to (2S,4R)-4-hydroxyproline (4-Hyp) is the most prevalent posttranslational modification in humans, catalyzed by prolyl 4-hydroxylase (P4H). Mammalian prolyl 4-hydroxylase is an alpha2 beta2 tetramer (Berg & Prockop 1973b). The 59-kDa alpha subunit contains the substrate-binding domain and the enzymic active site (Helaakoski et al. 1989). Humans and most other vertebrates have three isoforms of the alpha subunit, isoform alpha-1 is the most prevalent. The pair of alpha subunits can be any of the three isoforms (Gorres & Raines 2010). The 55-kDa beta subunit is protein disulphide isomerase (PDI), which has additional functions in collagen formation. As part of P4H it retains the tetramer in the ER lumen and maintains the otherwise insoluble alpha subunit in an active form (Vuori et al. 1992, Nietfeld & Kemp 1981). P4H is a member of the non-heme iron(II), alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase family. Molecular oxygen (O2), 2-oxoglutarate (alpha-ketoglutarate) and iron(II) are required for its activity (Hutton & Udenfriend 1966). During the reaction, alpha-ketoglutarate is oxidatively decarboxylated producing succinate and CO2 (Rhoads & Udenfriend 1968, Gorres & Raines 2010). Ascorbate is required as a cofactor but not consumed (Kivirikko et al 1989). The minimum substrate required for hydroxylation is an Xaa-Pro-Gly tripeptide, with Pro preferred in the Xaa position, though hydroxylation can occur at lower rates with a variety of residues at this position (Kivirikko et al. 1972).

During the reaction, alpha-ketoglutarate is oxidatively decarboxylated producing succinate and CO2 (Rhoads & Udenfriend 1968, Gorres & Raines 2010). Ascorbate is required as a cofactor but not consumed (Kivirikko et al 1989). The minimum substrate required for hydroxylation is an Xaa-Pro-Gly tripeptide, with Pro preferred in the Xaa position, though hydroxylation can occur at lower rates with a variety of residues at this position (Kivirikko et al. 1972).

Though it is now known that other proteins such as C1q and elastin also contain 4-Hyp, collagen is by far the major source (Adams & Frank 1980). 4-Hyp is required for collagen stability at physiological temperatures. The abundance of Hyp in animal proteins is ~4%, making it more abundant than the amino-acids Cys, Gln, His, Met, Phe, Trp and Tyr (McCaldon & Argos 1988). In collagen Hyp abundance is much higher at ~38% (Ramshaw et al. 1998). Full collagen proline hydroxylation significantly raises the melting temperature (Tm) by stabilizing the collagen triple helix (Berg & Prockop 1973a), a process that has been studied extensively using synthetic collagen peptides (Sakakibara et al. 1973, Holmgren et al. 1998) and is well understood at the structural level (Shoulders & Raines 2009). Collagen 4-Hyp content is relatively stable, with small differences between collagen types. Collagen type I has approximately 1 4-Hyp for every 10 residues, roughly 50% of available prolines (Kivirikko et al. 1992). Conversion of Pro to (2S,4R)-4-hydroxyproline (4-Hyp) is the most prevalent posttranslational modification in humans, catalyzed by prolyl 4-hydroxylase (P4H). Mammalian prolyl 4-hydroxylase is an alpha2 beta2 tetramer (Berg & Prockop 1973b). The 59-kDa alpha subunit contains the substrate-binding domain and the enzymic active site (Helaakoski et al. 1989). Humans and most other vertebrates have three isoforms of the alpha subunit, isoform alpha-1 is the most prevalent. The pair of alpha subunits can be any of the three isoforms (Gorres & Raines 2010). The 55-kDa beta subunit is protein disulphide isomerase (PDI), which has additional functions in collagen formation. As part of P4H it retains the tetramer in the ER lumen and maintains the otherwise insoluble alpha subunit in an active form (Vuori et al. 1992, Nietfeld & Kemp 1981).

The abundance of Hyp in animal proteins is ~4%, making it more abundant than the amino-acids Cys, Gln, His, Met, Phe, Trp and Tyr (McCaldon & Argos 1988). In collagen Hyp abundance is much higher at ~38% (Ramshaw et al. 1998). Full collagen proline hydroxylation significantly raises the melting temperature (Tm) by stabilizing the collagen triple helix (Berg & Prockop 1973a), a process that has been studied extensively using synthetic collagen peptides (Sakakibara et al. 1973, Holmgren et al. 1998) and is well understood at the structural level (Shoulders & Raines 2009). Collagen 4-Hyp content is relatively stable, with small differences between collagen types. Collagen type I has approximately 1 4-Hyp for every 10 residues, roughly 50% of available prolines (Kivirikko et al. 1992). Conversion of Pro to (2S,4R)-4-hydroxyproline (4-Hyp) is the most prevalent posttranslational modification in humans, catalyzed by prolyl 4-hydroxylase (P4H). Mammalian prolyl 4-hydroxylase is an alpha2 beta2 tetramer (Berg & Prockop 1973b). The 59-kDa alpha subunit contains the substrate-binding domain and the enzymic active site (Helaakoski et al. 1989). Humans and most other vertebrates have three isoforms of the alpha subunit, isoform alpha-1 is the most prevalent. The pair of alpha subunits can be any of the three isoforms (Gorres & Raines 2010). The 55-kDa beta subunit is protein disulphide isomerase (PDI), which has additional functions in collagen formation. As part of P4H it retains the tetramer in the ER lumen and maintains the otherwise insoluble alpha subunit in an active form (Vuori et al. 1992, Nietfeld & Kemp 1981). P4H is a member of the non-heme iron(II), alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase family. Molecular oxygen (O2), 2-oxoglutarate (alpha-ketoglutarate) and iron(II) are required for its activity (Hutton & Udenfriend 1966). During the reaction, alpha-ketoglutarate is oxidatively decarboxylated producing succinate and CO2 (Rhoads & Udenfriend 1968, Gorres & Raines 2010). Ascorbate is required as a cofactor but not consumed (Kivirikko et al 1989). The minimum substrate required for hydroxylation is an Xaa-Pro-Gly tripeptide, with Pro preferred in the Xaa position, though hydroxylation can occur at lower rates with a variety of residues at this position (Kivirikko et al. 1972). A number of other peptides, notably elastin, are substrates for P4H (Bhatnagar 1978).<br><br>For brevity, all forms of collagen propeptide are shown as having 3X 4-Hyp residues following the action of P4H."

Mammalian prolyl 4-hydroxylase is an alpha2 beta2 tetramer (Berg & Prockop 1973b). The 59-kDa alpha subunit contains the substrate-binding domain and the enzymic active site (Helaakoski et al. 1989). Humans and most other vertebrates have three isoforms of the alpha subunit, isoform alpha-1 is the most prevalent. The pair of alpha subunits can be any of the three isoforms (Gorres & Raines 2010). The 55-kDa beta subunit is protein disulphide isomerase (PDI), which has additional functions in collagen formation. As part of P4H it retains the tetramer in the ER lumen and maintains the otherwise insoluble alpha subunit in an active form (Vuori et al. 1992, Nietfeld & Kemp 1981). P4H is a member of the non-heme iron(II), alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase family. Molecular oxygen (O2), 2-oxoglutarate (alpha-ketoglutarate) and iron(II) are required for its activity (Hutton & Udenfriend 1966). During the reaction, alpha-ketoglutarate is oxidatively decarboxylated producing succinate and CO2 (Rhoads & Udenfriend 1968, Gorres & Raines 2010). Ascorbate is required as a cofactor but not consumed (Kivirikko et al 1989). The minimum substrate required for hydroxylation is an Xaa-Pro-Gly tripeptide, with Pro preferred in the Xaa position, though hydroxylation can occur at lower rates with a variety of residues at this position (Kivirikko et al. 1972). A number of other peptides, notably elastin, are substrates for P4H (Bhatnagar 1978).<br><br>For brevity, all forms of collagen propeptide are shown as having 3X 4-Hyp residues following the action of P4H."

Though it is now known that other proteins such as C1q and elastin also contain 4-Hyp, collagen is by far the major source (Adams & Frank 1980). 4-Hyp is required for collagen stability at physiological temperatures. The abundance of Hyp in animal proteins is ~4%, making it more abundant than the amino-acids Cys, Gln, His, Met, Phe, Trp and Tyr (McCaldon & Argos 1988). In collagen Hyp abundance is much higher at ~38% (Ramshaw et al. 1998). Full collagen proline hydroxylation significantly raises the melting temperature (Tm) by stabilizing the collagen triple helix (Berg & Prockop 1973a), a process that has been studied extensively using synthetic collagen peptides (Sakakibara et al. 1973, Holmgren et al. 1998) and is well understood at the structural level (Shoulders & Raines 2009).

Ascorbate is required as a cofactor but not consumed (Kivirikko et al 1989).

Though it is now known that other proteins such as C1q and elastin also contain 4-Hyp, collagen is by far the major source (Adams & Frank 1980). 4-Hyp is required for collagen stability at physiological temperatures. The abundance of Hyp in animal proteins is ~4%, making it more abundant than the amino-acids Cys, Gln, His, Met, Phe, Trp and Tyr (McCaldon & Argos 1988). In collagen Hyp abundance is much higher at ~38% (Ramshaw et al. 1998). Full collagen proline hydroxylation significantly raises the melting temperature (Tm) by stabilizing the collagen triple helix (Berg & Prockop 1973a), a process that has been studied extensively using synthetic collagen peptides (Sakakibara et al. 1973, Holmgren et al. 1998) and is well understood at the structural level (Shoulders & Raines 2009). Collagen 4-Hyp content is relatively stable, with small differences between collagen types. Collagen type I has approximately 1 4-Hyp for every 10 residues, roughly 50% of available prolines (Kivirikko et al. 1992). Conversion of Pro to (2S,4R)-4-hydroxyproline (4-Hyp) is the most prevalent posttranslational modification in humans, catalyzed by prolyl 4-hydroxylase (P4H). Mammalian prolyl 4-hydroxylase is an alpha2 beta2 tetramer (Berg & Prockop 1973b). The 59-kDa alpha subunit contains the substrate-binding domain and the enzymic active site (Helaakoski et al. 1989). Humans and most other vertebrates have three isoforms of the alpha subunit, isoform alpha-1 is the most prevalent. The pair of alpha subunits can be any of the three isoforms (Gorres & Raines 2010). The 55-kDa beta subunit is protein disulphide isomerase (PDI), which has additional functions in collagen formation. As part of P4H it retains the tetramer in the ER lumen and maintains the otherwise insoluble alpha subunit in an active form (Vuori et al. 1992, Nietfeld & Kemp 1981). P4H is a member of the non-heme iron(II), alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase family.

In collagen Hyp abundance is much higher at ~38% (Ramshaw et al. 1998). Full collagen proline hydroxylation significantly raises the melting temperature (Tm) by stabilizing the collagen triple helix (Berg & Prockop 1973a), a process that has been studied extensively using synthetic collagen peptides (Sakakibara et al. 1973, Holmgren et al. 1998) and is well understood at the structural level (Shoulders & Raines 2009). Collagen 4-Hyp content is relatively stable, with small differences between collagen types. Collagen type I has approximately 1 4-Hyp for every 10 residues, roughly 50% of available prolines (Kivirikko et al. 1992). Conversion of Pro to (2S,4R)-4-hydroxyproline (4-Hyp) is the most prevalent posttranslational modification in humans, catalyzed by prolyl 4-hydroxylase (P4H). Mammalian prolyl 4-hydroxylase is an alpha2 beta2 tetramer (Berg & Prockop 1973b). The 59-kDa alpha subunit contains the substrate-binding domain and the enzymic active site (Helaakoski et al. 1989). Humans and most other vertebrates have three isoforms of the alpha subunit, isoform alpha-1 is the most prevalent. The pair of alpha subunits can be any of the three isoforms (Gorres & Raines 2010). The 55-kDa beta subunit is protein disulphide isomerase (PDI), which has additional functions in collagen formation. As part of P4H it retains the tetramer in the ER lumen and maintains the otherwise insoluble alpha subunit in an active form (Vuori et al. 1992, Nietfeld & Kemp 1981). P4H is a member of the non-heme iron(II), alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase family. Molecular oxygen (O2), 2-oxoglutarate (alpha-ketoglutarate) and iron(II) are required for its activity (Hutton & Udenfriend 1966). During the reaction, alpha-ketoglutarate is oxidatively decarboxylated producing succinate and CO2 (Rhoads & Udenfriend 1968, Gorres & Raines 2010). Ascorbate is required as a cofactor but not consumed (Kivirikko et al 1989). The minimum substrate required for hydroxylation is an Xaa-Pro-Gly tripeptide, with Pro preferred in the Xaa position, though hydroxylation can occur at lower rates with a variety of residues at this position (Kivirikko et al. 1972). A number of other peptides, notably elastin, are substrates for P4H (Bhatnagar 1978).<br><br>For brevity, all forms of collagen propeptide are shown as having 3X 4-Hyp residues following the action of P4H."

PHD3__PHD1;HIF3A2014	8	translocation	"In the absence of Hh ligand, the Hh receptor PTCH inhibits signaling by negatively regulating the activity of SMO, a candidate member of the GPCR superfamily that transduces the Hh signal to downstream pathway components (reviewed in Ayers and Therond, 2010; Briscoe and Therond, 2013). Neither the mechanism by which SMO activates Hh signaling nor the manner in which PTCH represses this activty are fully elucidated, but these may involve regulation of putative SMO ligand(s) or changes in cellular localization, protein conformation and phosphorylation status, among other possibilities (reviewed in Briscoe and Therond, 2013; Ayers and Therond; 2010). <br>PTCH is a 7 transmembrane protein that is localized to the primary cilium in the absence of Hh ligand (Rohatgi et al, 2007). PTCH regulates SMO in a non-stoichiometric manner and there is little evidence that endogenous PTCH and SMO interact directly (Taipale et al, 2002; reviewed in Huangfu and Anderson, 2006). PTCH has a sterol sensing domain (SSD) and structural similarity to bacterial RND transporters. Mutation in conserved motifs in the RND domain abrogate the ability of PTCH to negatively regulate SMO activity (Taipale et al, 2002). The transmembrane heptahelical domain of SMO has been shown to bind to a number of natural and synthetic molecules, many of which are structurally related to sterols, and this binding can activate or repress SMO activity (Mas et al, 2010; Dwyer et al, 2007; Nachtergaele et al, 2012; Corcoran et al, 2006). Together, these data suggest a speculative model where PTCH regulates SMO activity by controlling the flux of sterol-related SMO agonists and/or antagonists, although this has not been fully substantiated (Khaliullina et al, 2009; reviewed in Rohatgi and Scott, 2007; Briscoe and Therond, 2013).<br>In the absence of Hh signal, SMO is largely found in intracellular vesicles, with a fraction localized to the plasma membrane (Milenkovic et al, 2009; Huangfu et al, 2006; Corbit et al, 2005; Rohatgi et al, 2007; Wang et al, 2009; Wilson et al, 2009). Like GLI2, 3 and SUFU, however, SMO may traffic through the cilium in the absence of ligand (Wilson et al, 2009; Kim et al, 2009). SMO and PTCH appear to have opposing localizations in both the 'off' and 'on' state, with PTCH exiting and SMO entering the cilium upon Hh pathway activation (Denef et al, 2000; Rohatgi et al, 2007; reviewed in Goetz and Anderson, 2010; Hui and Angers, 2011). Clearance of PTCH from the ciliary membrane in the presence of Hh is promoted by its ubiquitination by the E3 ligase SMURF (Huang et al, 2013; Yue et al, 2014)<br>Like the Drosophila homologue, vertebrate SMO appears to exists as a constitutive dimer. Dimerization is mediated by the N-terminal Cys-rich domain (CRD) and is required for function (Zhao et al, 2007). The C-terminal tail of SMO has arginine-rich clusters that appear to regulate the conformation of the tails in the dimer, maintaining the SMO dimer in an inactive state. In Drosophila, the inhibitory effect of the arginine-rich region is counteracted upon Hh pathway activation by PKA-mediated phosphorylation of adjacent serine residues. This promotes an open tail conformation that is required for cell surface accumulation and signaling (Zhao et al, 2007; Chen et al, 2010). These consensus PKA motifs are not conserved in the vertebrate SMO C-terminal tail, and a role for PKA-mediated phosphorylation and direct activation of SMO appears not to hold true in mammalian cells (Zhao et al, 2007; Tuson et al, 2011).

Before Protein kinase C (PKC) is competent to respond to second messengers it must first be phosphorylated at three conserved positions: the activation loop and two positions at the carboxyl terminus of the protein (Dutil et al. 1998).

Although both Mib1 and Mib2 ubiquitinate Delta (Koo et al. 2005), only Mib1 was shown to be essential for normal development in mice, with Mib1 deficient mice exhibiting typical Notch deficiency phenotypes (Koo et al. 2007). This could be due to different expression patterns of Mib1 and Mib2.

Mouse Neurl was directly shown to ubiquitinate Jag1 but not other Notch ligands in vitro. N-terminal myristoylation targets Neurl to the plasma membrane and this is a prerequisite for Jag1 internalization (Koutelou et al. 2008).

This occurs in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (Engel & Prockop 1991). Compared with the folding of globular proteins and coiled-coil structures, the concentration-independent folding steps of collagen are extremely slow (BÃ_chinger et al. 1980). Triple helix formation combines a fast process, interpreted as the folding of regions devoid of cis residues, and a slow process, limited by the slow kinetics of cis to trans prolyl-isomerization (BÃ_chinger et al. 1978). Triple-helix formation in regions devoid of cis-prolyl bonds is 3-4 times faster than formation limited by prolyl isomerization reactions (Bachmann et al. 2005). Conversion to trans is required as only trans-peptide bonds can be incorporated into the collagen triple helix (Zeng et al. 1998). Efficient helix folding requires the presence of the 3-prolyl hydroxylation complex. This trimer of Prolyl 3-hydroxylase 1 (LEPRE1), Cyclophilin B (CyPB), also called Peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase B (PPIB) and CRTAP has 3-prolyl hydroxylase, PPIase and procollagen chaperone properties (Ishikawa et al. 2009, van Dijk et al. 2009). Efficient folding involves additional collagen-specific chaperones such as Serpin H1 (HSP47 - Smith et al. 1995). CyPB belongs to the cyclophilins, a conserved class of intracellular and/or secreted proteins originally identified as cellular binding proteins for the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A. They are peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerases (PPIases), which catalyze the cis-trans isomerisation of peptide bonds. CyPB localises to the rough ER but is also secreted extracellularly. It directly interacts with procollagen and is believed to be responsible for converting procollagen cis- to trans-conformers (Zeng et al. 1998). CyPB and Serpin H1 are also involved in procollagen export and secretion. Results obtained with collagen peptides suggest that variations in the Gly-X-Y sequence are likely to result in a non-uniform helical twist along the length of a collagen fibril.

Compared with the folding of globular proteins and coiled-coil structures, the concentration-independent folding steps of collagen are extremely slow (BÃ_chinger et al. 1980). Triple helix formation combines a fast process, interpreted as the folding of regions devoid of cis residues, and a slow process, limited by the slow kinetics of cis to trans prolyl-isomerization (BÃ_chinger et al. 1978). Triple-helix formation in regions devoid of cis-prolyl bonds is 3-4 times faster than formation limited by prolyl isomerization reactions (Bachmann et al. 2005). Conversion to trans is required as only trans-peptide bonds can be incorporated into the collagen triple helix (Zeng et al. 1998). Efficient helix folding requires the presence of the 3-prolyl hydroxylation complex. This trimer of Prolyl 3-hydroxylase 1 (LEPRE1), Cyclophilin B (CyPB), also called Peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase B (PPIB) and CRTAP has 3-prolyl hydroxylase, PPIase and procollagen chaperone properties (Ishikawa et al. 2009, van Dijk et al. 2009). Efficient folding involves additional collagen-specific chaperones such as Serpin H1 (HSP47 - Smith et al. 1995). CyPB belongs to the cyclophilins, a conserved class of intracellular and/or secreted proteins originally identified as cellular binding proteins for the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A. They are peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerases (PPIases), which catalyze the cis-trans isomerisation of peptide bonds. CyPB localises to the rough ER but is also secreted extracellularly. It directly interacts with procollagen and is believed to be responsible for converting procollagen cis- to trans-conformers (Zeng et al. 1998). CyPB and Serpin H1 are also involved in procollagen export and secretion. Results obtained with collagen peptides suggest that variations in the Gly-X-Y sequence are likely to result in a non-uniform helical twist along the length of a collagen fibril.

Triple-helix formation in regions devoid of cis-prolyl bonds is 3-4 times faster than formation limited by prolyl isomerization reactions (Bachmann et al. 2005). Conversion to trans is required as only trans-peptide bonds can be incorporated into the collagen triple helix (Zeng et al. 1998). Efficient helix folding requires the presence of the 3-prolyl hydroxylation complex. This trimer of Prolyl 3-hydroxylase 1 (LEPRE1), Cyclophilin B (CyPB), also called Peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase B (PPIB) and CRTAP has 3-prolyl hydroxylase, PPIase and procollagen chaperone properties (Ishikawa et al. 2009, van Dijk et al. 2009). Efficient folding involves additional collagen-specific chaperones such as Serpin H1 (HSP47 - Smith et al. 1995). CyPB belongs to the cyclophilins, a conserved class of intracellular and/or secreted proteins originally identified as cellular binding proteins for the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A. They are peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerases (PPIases), which catalyze the cis-trans isomerisation of peptide bonds. CyPB localises to the rough ER but is also secreted extracellularly. It directly interacts with procollagen and is believed to be responsible for converting procollagen cis- to trans-conformers (Zeng et al. 1998). CyPB and Serpin H1 are also involved in procollagen export and secretion. Results obtained with collagen peptides suggest that variations in the Gly-X-Y sequence are likely to result in a non-uniform helical twist along the length of a collagen fibril. Sequences poor in imino acids will have a symmetry close to 10 tripeptide units for every 3 turns of the triple helix (10/3), while stretches of Gly-Pro-Hyp units may have 7/2 symmetry (Brodsky & Persikov 2005)."

Cyclin D1 is an allosteric regulator of CDK4 and CDK6, mediating growth factor-dependent G1-phase progression. Growth factor stimulation induces cyclin D1 expression, its association with CDK4 and nuclear accumulation during mid-G1. Active cyclin D1:CDK4 catalyzes the phosphorylation-dependent inactivation of retinoblastoma (RB) family proteins (Diehl 2002, Gladden & Diehl 2005). Following the G1/S transition, cyclin D1 accumulation is opposed by phosphorylation of threonine-286 (T286) by glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3beta), which promotes cyclin D1 nuclear export (Alt et al. 2000)."

JAK2 V617F can phosphorylate STAT5 in the absence of upstream signals, which confers cytokine-independent growth to Ba/F3 cells and induces a myeloproliferative disease in mouse models (Akada et al. 2010, Marty et al., 2010, Mullally et al. 2010). JAK2 V617F phosphorylates PRMT5 predominantly at tyrosines 297, 304, and 307, significantly reducing the activity-enhancing interaction between PRMT5 and WDR77 (MEP50) (Liu et al. 2011)."	JAK2 V617F;ANM52012	8	translocation	"E-cadherin (CDH1) localizes to the lateral membrane of differentiated epithelia, providing the structural foundation for adherens junctions, multiprotein complexes that link cell-cell contacts to the actin cytoskeleton and various signaling molecules (Perez-Moreno et al. 2003, Baum & Georgiou 2011). The extracellular domain has five cadherin-type repeat ectodomain (EC) modules; the most membrane-distal EC mediates binding with CDH1 on adjacent cells (Boggon et al. 2002). Calcium ions bind between the EC domains of two CDH1 peptides to form a dimer with a rod-like conformation (Boggon et al. 2002) which is required for cell-cell interaction (Gumbiner 1996, Patel et al. 2006). The cytoplasmic tail of E-cadherin binds to the armadillo repeat protein beta-catenin, a target of the Wnt signaling pathway and a cofactor for TCF/LEF-mediated transcription (Gavard & MÃ¨ge 2005). Beta-catenin in turn binds alpha-catenin, which interacts with the actin microfilament network, actin and the actin-binding proteins vinculin, formins, alpha-actinin, zonula occludin protein, and afadin (Bershadsky 2004). CellÂ–cell adhesions also contain desmosomes, which link cell contacts to intermediate filaments, and nectin-based, calcium-independent adhesions, which are linked to actin (Takai & Nakanishi 2003, Yin and Green 2004). The critical importance of E-cadherin to normal development and tissue function is demonstrated by embryonic lethal E-cadherin gene mouse knockouts (Larue et al. 1994). Loss of cadherin-based cell-cell adhesion is a hallmark of carcinogenesis, correlating with tumour progression, allowing cells to escape normal growth control signals, resulting in loss of differentiation and increased cell proliferation associated with invasive behaviour (Frixen et al. 1991, Capaldo & Macara 2007). Full-length 120-kDa CDH1 protein is cleaved in the ectodomain close to the plasma membrane by a number of metalloproteases, generating an extracellular 38-kDa C-terminal fragment (CTF) termed CTF1 which can be further processed by a gamma-secretase-like activity to a soluble 33-kDa CTF2 (Marambaud et al. 2002, Roy & Berx 2008). MMP3, MMP7 (NoÃ« et al. 2001, canine MMPs), MMP9 (Symowicz et al. 2007), plasmin (Ryniers et al. 2002, canine plasmin), Kallikrien 7 (Johnson et al. 2007), ADAM10 (Maretzky et al. 2005) and ADAM15 (Najy et al. 2008) all cleave CDH1 extracellularly, close to the transmembrane region. Presenilin-1 (Marambaud et al. 2002), the catalytic subunit of gamma-secretase (Herreman et al. 2003, Li et al. 2003), cleaves CDH1 producing a soluble 33-kDa fragment termed CTF2. Other enzymes like caspase-3 (Steinhusen et al. 2001) and calpain-1 (Rios-Doria et al. 2003) cleave E-cadherin in its cytoplasmic part releasing an intracellular 37 kDa C-terminal fragment."

The 3-Hyp content of collagen is much more variable than that of 4-Hyp, varying between collagen types, tissues, developmental stages and pathological states (Kivirikko et al. 1992). It is more prevalent in type IV and V collagens at 10-15 3-Hyp residues (Bentz et al. 1983) than in Type I-III fibrillar collagens which have a single 3-Hyp residue per chain; the alpha-1 chain of type I collagen has 3-Hyp at residue 986 (Fietzek et al. 1972, Marini et al. 2007). 3-Hyp is formed from Pro in the Xaa position of Xaa-Hyp-Gly triplets (Gryder et al. 1975, Kivirikko et al. 1992). It is likely that 4-Hyp is a requirement at the second position of the triplet as 4-Hyp rich substrates are more active than 4-Hyp poor (Adams & Frank 1980). 3-Hyp has a modest effect on triple-helix stability (Jenkins et al. 2003; Mizuno et al. 2008). 3-Hyp may adjust the stability of basement membranes to enable formation of the meshwork structure, or serve as a ligand for other proteins.

Like P4H, P3H requires molecular oxygen, alpha-ketoglutarate, iron(II), and ascorbate for activity. P3H1 is homologous to mammalian leprecan or growth suppressor 1 (Gros1), and forms a 3-prolyl hydroxylation complex with cartilage-associated protein (CRTAP) and a peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase, cyclophilin B (CypB), which is encoded by the PPIB gene (Vranka et al. 2004).

The 3-Hyp content of collagen is much more variable than that of 4-Hyp, varying between collagen types, tissues, developmental stages and pathological states (Kivirikko et al. 1992). It is more prevalent in type IV and V collagens at 10-15 3-Hyp residues (Bentz et al. 1983) than in Type I-III fibrillar collagens which have a single 3-Hyp residue per chain; the alpha-1 chain of type I collagen has 3-Hyp at residue 986 (Fietzek et al. 1972, Marini et al. 2007). 3-Hyp is formed from Pro in the Xaa position of Xaa-Hyp-Gly triplets (Gryder et al. 1975, Kivirikko et al. 1992).

Like P4H, P3H requires molecular oxygen, alpha-ketoglutarate, iron(II), and ascorbate for activity. P3H1 is homologous to mammalian leprecan or growth suppressor 1 (Gros1), and forms a 3-prolyl hydroxylation complex with cartilage-associated protein (CRTAP) and a peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase, cyclophilin B (CypB), which is encoded by the PPIB gene (Vranka et al. 2004). Lack of 3-Hyp in Type I and II collagens leads to an osteogenesis imperfecta (OI)-like disease, as demonstrated by CRTAP and PPIB knock-out mice (Morello et al. 2006, Choi et al. 2009) and by mutations in human LEPRE1 (which encodes P3H1), CRTAP, and PPIB (Barnes et al. 2006, Cabral et al. 2007, van Dijk et al. 2009).

P3H2 hydroxylates peptides derived from Type IV collagen more efficiently than Type I peptides and is localized to tissues that are rich in basement membrane (Tiainen et al. 2008). The effect of prolyl 3-hydroxylation on basement membrane collagens remains unknown.<br><br> In this generalized reaction, all collagen subtypes are represented as having one 3-Hyp residue."

Moreover, inactive HSF1 was reported to constitutively shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm in mammalian cells (Vujanac M et al. 2005). However, active HSF1 trimers were shown to rapidly accumulate in the nucleus where they bind to heat shock elements (HSE) present within promoters of hsp genes (Wang Y and Morgan WD 1994; Herbomel G et al. 2013).<p>Heat shock response in human and monkey cells (but not rodent cells) is also associated with the stress-induced relocalization of HSF1 within the nucleus not only on hsp gene promoters but also into specific subnuclear organelles termed nuclear stress bodies (nSBs, also known as HSF1 granules) (Sarge KD et a. 1993; Cotto JJ et al. 1997; Jolly C et al. 1999). nSBs are rarely detectable in unstressed cells but their number drastically increases after heat shock. Formation of nSBs is initiated by the interaction between HSF1 and pericentric tandem repeats of satellite III sequences on chromosome 9, where sat III repeats are transcribed by RNA polymerase II in an HSF1-dependent manner. (Jolly C et al. 2002, 2004). HSF1 can also bind to DNA regions enriched in sat II and sat III repeated sequences detected on other human chromosomes (Eymery A et al. 2010).

The p130CAS SD undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation and mediates signals by recruiting downstream effectors. The SD is characterised by fifteen YxxP motifs, of which ten can be efficiently phosphorylated by Src family kinases (SFKs) (Shin et al. 2004). FAK kinase phosphorylates the nearby SBD tyrosines 664 and 666 (mouse 668/670).

These data are consistent with a role for PKA-mediated phosphorylation in promoting the proteasome-dependent degradation of GLI1 in the absence of Hh signal, as is the case for GLI2 and GLI3 (Huntzicker et al, 2006; Tempe et al, 2006; Pan and Wang, 2007; Pan et al, 2009).

The kinase responsible for Cbl phosphorylation may be dependent on cell type; Fyn is demonstrated to have the ability to phosphorylate Cbl (Hunter et al. 1999), other candidates include Hck, Lyn (Hunter et al. 1999) and Syk (Park et al. 1998).<br><br> Tyrosines 700, 731 and 774 are the major sites of Cbl phosphorylation by non-receptor protein tyrosine kinases, with none showing any particular specificity for sites (Tsygankov et al. 2001). Fyn was observed to be constitutively associated with Cbl in lysates of several different cell types including the interleukin-3-dependent murine myeloid cell line 32Dcl3, and the prolactin-dependent rat thymoma cell line Nb2. Cbl phosphorylation at Y731 is postulated to provide an additional interaction between Cbl and the SH2 domain of p85-PI3K (Hunter et al. 1999). Cbl-p85 association increases in activated cells (Panchamoorthy et al. 1996). Expression of a Cbl Y731F mutant which abolishes binding of Cbl to p85 markedly increased levels of p85-PI3K (Dufour et al. 2008).

Ser230 is located in this regulatory domain of HSF1 and is constitutively and stress-inducibly phosphorylated (Holmberg CI et al. 2001). Analyses with phosphopeptide-specific antibody and site-directed mutagenesis revealed that phosphorylation at Ser230 enhanced the inducible HSF1 transcriptional activity in heat-shocked human K562 erythroleukemia and HeLa cells (Holmberg CI et al 2001). Active calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) was shown to phosphorylate HSF1 at Ser230 in vitro. Moreover, CaMKII enhanced heat-induced tranactivating capacity of HSF1 and the level of endogenous Ser230 phosphorylation in K562 cells transfected with active CaMKII together with a CAT reporter plasmid containing the proximal HSE of human hsp70 promoter. Thus, CaMKII signaling may be involved in the positive regulation of HSF1-mediated transactivation. However, the possibility that other protein kinases might also phosphorylate Ser230 in vivo should not be excluded (Holmberg CI et al 2001)."

They are differentially phosphorylated by diverse agonists and implicated in transmitting different signals and effects (Ciccimaro et al. 2006, Le Boeuf et al. 2004,2006). Y397 is the major autophosphorylation site present upstream of the FAK kinase domain (Schaller et al. 1994). In response to VEGF stimulation FAK1 is recruited and autophosphorylated at Y397.

Gt is a heterotrimer of alpha1 (GNAT1) (van Dop et al. 1989, Fong 1992), beta1 (GNB1) (Codina et al. 1986) and gamma1 (GNGT1) (Tao et al. 1993) subunits. Photoactivated rhodopsin (MII or R*) catalyzes the exchange of GTP for GDP bound to Gt. Upon GTP/GDP exchange, Gt is released from MII and the Gt alpha with GTP bound (GNAT1 GTP) dissociates from Gt beta gamma subunits (GNB1:GNGT1). This mechanism was deciphered from bovine experiments (Pugh & Lamb 1993). MII proceeds to activate additional Gt molecules, making this reaction the first amplification step in the phototransduction cascade. A single activated rhodopsin molecule activates tens of Gt molecules.

OTUD5;TRAF32012	8	translocation	"E-cadherin (CDH1) localizes to the lateral membrane of differentiated epithelia, providing the structural foundation for adherens junctions, multiprotein complexes that link cell-cell contacts to the actin cytoskeleton and various signaling molecules (Perez-Moreno et al. 2003, Baum & Georgiou 2011). The extracellular domain has five cadherin-type repeat ectodomain (EC) modules; the most membrane-distal EC mediates binding with CDH1 on adjacent cells (Boggon et al. 2002). Calcium ions bind between the EC domains of two CDH1 peptides to form a dimer with a rod-like conformation (Boggon et al. 2002) which is required for cell-cell interaction (Gumbiner 1996, Patel et al. 2006). The cytoplasmic tail of E-cadherin binds to the armadillo repeat protein beta-catenin, a target of the Wnt signaling pathway and a cofactor for TCF/LEF-mediated transcription (Gavard & MÃ¨ge 2005). Beta-catenin in turn binds alpha-catenin, which interacts with the actin microfilament network, actin and the actin-binding proteins vinculin, formins, alpha-actinin, zonula occludin protein, and afadin (Bershadsky 2004). CellÂ–cell adhesions also contain desmosomes, which link cell contacts to intermediate filaments, and nectin-based, calcium-independent adhesions, which are linked to actin (Takai & Nakanishi 2003, Yin and Green 2004). The critical importance of E-cadherin to normal development and tissue function is demonstrated by embryonic lethal E-cadherin gene mouse knockouts (Larue et al. 1994). Loss of cadherin-based cell-cell adhesion is a hallmark of carcinogenesis, correlating with tumour progression, allowing cells to escape normal growth control signals, resulting in loss of differentiation and increased cell proliferation associated with invasive behaviour (Frixen et al. 1991, Capaldo & Macara 2007). Full-length 120-kDa CDH1 protein is cleaved in the ectodomain close to the plasma membrane by a number of metalloproteases, generating an extracellular 38-kDa C-terminal fragment (CTF) termed CTF1 which can be further processed by a gamma-secretase-like activity to a soluble 33-kDa CTF2 (Marambaud et al. 2002, Roy & Berx 2008). MMP3, MMP7 (NoÃ« et al. 2001, canine MMPs), MMP9 (Symowicz et al. 2007), plasmin (Ryniers et al. 2002, canine plasmin), Kallikrien 7 (Johnson et al. 2007), ADAM10 (Maretzky et al. 2005) and ADAM15 (Najy et al. 2008) all cleave CDH1 extracellularly, close to the transmembrane region. Presenilin-1 (Marambaud et al. 2002), the catalytic subunit of gamma-secretase (Herreman et al. 2003, Li et al. 2003), cleaves CDH1 producing a soluble 33-kDa fragment termed CTF2. Other enzymes like caspase-3 (Steinhusen et al. 2001) and calpain-1 (Rios-Doria et al. 2003) cleave E-cadherin in its cytoplasmic part releasing an intracellular 37 kDa c-terminal fragment."

IL1B production and processing is stimulated when pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) such as bacterial LPS are detected by cells of the innate immune system, and in response to pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF. Detection of PAMPs by Toll receptors leads to rapid IL1 transcription/translation and subsequent processing by caspase-1 in macrophages and monocytes. Processing is triggered by the activation of members of the NLR family and their associated inflammasome complexes. IL1B lacks a signal peptide to direct it to the Golgi for subsequent secretion, so the mode of secretion is uncertain. Once secreted, IL1B binds membrane-bound IL1 receptors, followed by recruitment of the IL1 receptor accessory protein to form a high affinity receptor complex. Ligand induced receptor activation induces the intracellular association of a number of cytosolic adapter proteins triggering intracellular signal transduction. This series of steps facilitates the induction of nuclear factor-kappa B (NFkB) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activity, leading to downstream transcription of additional inflammatory cytokines, including IL1B itself. A calpain-like potease has been reported to be important for the processing of pro- IL1A, but much less is known about how IL1A is released from cells and what specific roles it plays in biology."

Tpx;tpx2010	8	adds_modification	"Similar models explain JAK activation by the cytokine-like hormone receptors (GHR and PRLR) and interleukin receptors. JAK2 activation is believed to occur as mutual transactivation whereby JAK2 bound to one receptor chain phosphorylates JAK2 bound to the other receptor chain in the dimeric receptor. Transactivation is widely accepted (Herrington & Carter-Su 2001) having been originally proposed in the 1990's (Quelle et al. 1994, Hou et al. 2002). JAK phosphorylation is thought to lock the kinase domain in an active state; prior to this JAK2 is held in an inactive state by interactions between its kinase and pseudokinase domains (Giordanetto & Kroemer 2002). Although there are structures of JAK kinase domains (e.g. Lucet et al. 2006), no complete JAK structures are available and the activation mechanism remains poorly understood (Brooks & Waters 2010). The trigger for JAK activation is believed to be a conformational change in the receptor when ligand is bound, leading to a rotation of the cytoplasmic regions which brings the catalytic domains of bound JAK2 molecules into close proximity and frees them from inhibition by the pseudokinase domains. Supporting observations for cytokine-like hormone receptors include: JAK2 becomes tyrosine phosphorylated as a consequence of GHR activation by GH (Argetsinger et al. 1993); JAK2 is activated following PRLR activation (Campbell et al. 1994, Rui et al. 1994); forced dimerization of GH receptor domains is sufficient to activate signaling (Behncken et al. 2000); phosphorylation of JAK2 at Y1007 is critical for kinase activation (Feng et al. 1997, Lucet et al. 2006); JAK autophosphorylation at several other sites appears to regulate activity (e.g. Feener et al. 2004, Argetsinger et al. 2004, 2010).

After PIP2 hydrolysis, RasGRPs are recruited to the plasma membrane by binding to DAG and calcium (Stone 2011, Liu et al. 2007).

Other inhibitors in clinical trials, such as BKM120 (Maira et al. 2012), GDC0941 (Folkes et al. 2008, Junttila et al. 2009) and XL147 (Chakrabarty et al. 2012), are specific for class I PI3Ks and exhibit no activity against mTOR. Current research aims to identify isoform-specific PI3K inhibitors. Small molecule inhibitors that selectively inhibit PIK3CA (p110alpha), e.g. PIK-75 and A66, were used to study the role of p110alpha in signaling and growth of tumor cells (Knight et al. 2006, Sun et al. 2010, Jamieson et al. 2011, Utermark et al. 2012). The PIK3CB (p110beta) specific inhibitor TGX221 has been used in in vitro models of vascular injury (Jackson et al. 2005), and the TGX221 derivative KIN-193 has been shown to block AKT activity and tumor growth in mice with p110beta activation or PTEN loss (Ni et al. 2012). CAL-101 is a PIK3CD (p110delta) specific inhibitor that is being clinically investigated as a therapeutic for lymphoid malignancies (Herman et al. 2010). It is hoped that, in the future, more specific inhibitors, such as those targeting selective PI3K isoforms, will provide optimum treatment while minimizing unwanted side effects.

Fibromodulin and lumican bind the same site while the binding site for decorin is distinct (Hedbom & Heinegard 1993). All appear to be involved in collagen fibril formation and matrix assembly (Ameye & Young 2002, Kalamajski & Oldberg 2010). DCN consists of a core protein of approximately 40 kDa attached to a single chondroitin or dermatan sulfate glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chain. It interacts with collagen types I, II (Vogel et al. 1984), III (Witos et al. 2011), V (Whinna et al. 1993), VI (Bidanset et al. 1992) and XIV (Ehnis et al. 1997). It binds collagen I and II near the N-terminus, placing it at the 'd' band gap in the fibril structure (Kalamajski et al. 2007). The binding site for DCN on collagen XIV is in the NH2-terminal fibronectin type III repeat. In addition, an auxiliary binding site located COOH-terminally to this fibronectin type III repeat interacts with the glycosaminoglycan component of DCN. DCN binding regulates fibrillogenesis (Vogel et al. 1984, Orgel et al. 2006). One molecule of DCN interacts with four to six collagen molecules. The interaction is between collagen and the core protein, not the GAG chain, and is more likely to involve the monomeric, not dimeric form (Orgel et al. 2009). Fibronectin (Winnemoller et al. 1991) and thrombospondin-1 (Winnemoller et al. 1992) are also DCN interactors. DCN acts as a sink for all three isoforms of TGF-Beta, binding them when already bound to collagen (Markmann et al. 2000). Degradation of DCN by matrix metalloproteinases MMP-2, -3 or -7 results in release of TGF-beta (Imai et al. 1997).

Xenopus and zebrafish each have one FRAT gene, while the human and mouse genomes contains two and three, respectively (Jonkers et al, 1997; reviewed in van Amerongen and Berns, 2005). Frat proteins activate WNT signaling by binding to GSK3beta and inhibiting its phosphorylation of beta-catenin (Yost et al, 1998; van Amerongen et al, 2004). The interaction with GSK3beta is mediated by a highly conserved IKEA box in the C-terminal domain of FRAT (Yost et al, 1998; van Amerongen et al, 2004; Thomas et al, 1999). This region of FRAT is able to compete with AXIN for binding to GSK3beta, suggesting a model where FRAT is able to destabilize the destruction complex by abrogating the GSK3beta-AXIN interaction (Farr et al, 2000; Thomas et al, 1999; Fraser at el, 2002; Ferkey et al, 2002). This model is supported by structural studies showing that AXIN and FRAT bind to the same region on the surface of GSK3beta (Bax et al, 2001; Dajani et al, 2003). Endogenous FRAT1 has also been shown to interact with DVL3, and this reaction persists in a FRAT1 mutant lacking the GSK3beta-interacting domain (Li et al, 1999). FRAT proteins may thus help bridge between GSK3betaÂ’s role in the destruction complex and its role in activating signaling in response to WNT.<br><br>Despite the apparent importance of FRAT proteins in beta-catenin-dependent signaling, a triple FRAT knockout mouse shows no readily evident defects in canonical signaling and, unlike the GBP knockout in Xenopus, no overt phenotypic defects (van Amerongen et al, 2005; Yost et al, 1989). The in vivo role and significance of the FRAT proteins in WNT signaling remains to be resolved; it is worth noting, however, that FRAT proteins have also recently been shown to be involved in non-canonical WNT signaling in a GSK3beta-independent manner. It is possible that it is through this non-canonical role that FRAT proteins contribute to oncogenesis (van Amerongen et al, 2010; Walf-VorderwÃ_lbecke et al, 2012)."

The C-terminal end of beta-catenin interacts with a wide range of general transcriptional activators and chromatin remodelers, while the N-terminal region recruits more WNT-specific activators including BCL9 and Pygopus (reviewed in Jessen et al, 2008). BCL9 proteins (2 in vertebrates, BCL9 and BCL9L) interact with both beta-catenin and the putative activator Pygo (also 2 in vertebrates, Pygo1 and Pygo2) and in this way function as a bridging molecule to promote WNT-dependent transcription (reviewed in Valenta et al, 2012).<br>BCL9 was identified as the gene overexpressed in a B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line (Willis et al, 1998) and was subsequently found to be homologous to Legless (Lgs), a Drosophila gene identified in a number of screens for components of the WNT signalling pathway (Kramps et al, 2002; Belenkaya et al, 2002; Thompson et al, 2002). Lgs and BCL9 have no recognizable protein motifs and share sequence similarity only in three short stretches of 30 amino acids termed homology domains (HD) 1-3 (Kramps et al, 2002; reviewed in Valenta et al, 2012). HD1 mediates the interaction with the N-terminal ARM domain of beta-catenin while HD2 is required for the recruitment of Pygo through its C-terminal plant homology domain (PHD) (Kramps et al, 2002; Sampietro et al, 2006, Sierra et al, 2006). Replacement of the PHD domain of Pygo with the beta-catenin-interacting HD2 domain of Lgs rescues the phenotype of both lgs and pygo deletion in Drosophila suggesting that the primary role of Lgs is the recruitment of Pygo (Kramps et al, 2002). Transcriptional activation by Pygo depends on the conserved tripeptide NPF in the N-terminal homology domain (NHD) (Kramps et al, 2002; Hoffmans and Basler, 2004; Hoffmans et al, 2005; StÃ_deli and Basler, 2005).<br>In Drosophila, Lgs is essential for Wg signalling, and deletion of either Lgs or Pygo phenocopies armadillo (the Drosophila beta-catenin homologue) null mutants (Kramps et al, 2002; Thompson et al, 2002). In mammals, the requirement and roles for BCL9 and Pygo are both less strict and less completely understood. Unlike in Drosophila, disruption of the BCL9/Pygo branch in mammals has less impact on transcriptional activation than abrogation of beta-catenin-dependent signalling through the C-terminal tail (Valenta et al, 2011). Ablation of pygopus genes in mice does not phenocopy with loss of Wnt signaling (Song et al, 2007; Schwab et al, 2007; Li et al, 2007), and disruption of the BCL9/BCL9L beta-catenin interaction results in embryonic lethality three days later than in the case of complete disruption of beta-catenin-dependent transcription (Valenta et al, 2011). Mammalian BCL9 also has Pygo-independent roles in WNT signaling and has been shown to interact directly with other transcriptional co-activators such as CBP/p300 or TRRAP/GCN5 through its C-terminus (Sustmann et al, 2008). Finally, the PHD of Pygo is able to bind methylated histones, which may contribute to context-specific roles of the protein (Gu et al, 2009; Fielder et al, 2008; Kessler et al, 2009; Gu et al, 2012)."

Purified laminins are the only basement membrane component able to assemble on cell surfaces in the absence of other components (McKee et al. 2007). Laminin knockouts prevent basement membrane assembly, arresting development at a much earlier stage than knockouts of other ECM components such as collagen IV, nidogens (entactin), perlecan or agrin (Yurchenko et al. 2004). This suggests a regulatory function for the laminin network. Laminin molecules bind to each other in a three-way interaction involving the LN domains located at the end of the three short arms. Each interaction involves one each of alpha, beta and gamma laminin subunits (Yurchenko & Cheng 1993, McKee et al. 2007) forming a polygonal structure (Yurchenko et al. 1992). <br><br>In the basement membrane collagen type IV and laminin are found in an approximately 1:1 molar ratio (Kleinman et al. 1986).

Mutant mouse and human cells that lack functional UNC93B1 showed disrupted signaling via the endosomal TLRs (Taneda K et al 2006; Fukui et al 2009; Kim YM et al 2008; Qi R et al 2010; Koehn J et al 2007). Furthermore, defects in the human gene encoding UNC93B1 are associated with the increased susceptibility to herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE) in children (Casrouge A et al 2006).<p>TLR7 and TLR9 compete for UNC931-dependent trafficking and under normal circumstances TLR9 predominates over TLR7. This preference for TLR9 is mediated by an N-terminal domain in UNC93B1 and is reversed to TLR7 if UNC93B1 loses the preferential N-terminal binding site via mutation of aspartate at position 34. Loss of binding to TLR9 and preferential association with TLR7 resulted in hyperresponsiveness to RNA ligands (Fukui et al 2009).<p>TLR3 appears to translocate to the endosomal compartment with equal efficiency regardless of the presence or absence of the N-terminal domain that mediates preference for TLR9. Thus, endosomal TLR trafficking is orchestrated by UNC93B1 which determines how efficiently each TLR is able to move from the ER to the endolysosomes to initiate host responses."

They bind to the Frizzled (FZD) family of seven-pass transmembrane proteins and initiate at least three different intracellular signaling pathways. Historically they were considered to be family B GPCRs but more recent phylogenetic classifications put them into a class of their own (e.g. Schioth & Fredriksson 2005). FZD members have been demonstrated to signal via Gi/o (Slusarski et al. 1997) but this is not considered to be the primary signaling mechanism for these receptors (Hsieh 2004). Instead they signal through the canonical/beta-catenin pathway, the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway and the Wnt/Ca2+ pathway. The canonical/beta-catenin pathway requires a co-receptor protein known as LDL5 or LDL6 (Tamai et al. 2000). <br>Most Wnt signaling has been attributed to the activation of FZD receptors but there is evidence of FZD-independent signaling (Mikels & Nusse 2006).

Substitution of Ser303 with alanine derepresses the transactivation domain such that the S303A mutant showed increased transcriptional activity in human and mouse cells (Knauf U et al. 1996; Kline MP & Morimoto RI 1997). Phosphorylation of HSF1 at Ser303 was mediated by glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) activity in human acute monocytic leukemia THP1 cells and mouse embryonic fibroblast NIH 3T3 cells (Chu B et al. 1996, 1998). However, the other group showed that GSK3 inhibits HSF1 activity in HeLa cells through a mechanism that is independent of Ser303 phosphorylation, thus suggesting that Ser303 may be phosphorylated by multiple MAPKs (Batista?Nascimento L et al. 2011). The phosphorylation at Ser303 in turn promoted HSF1 association with YWHAE (14-3-3 epsilon), which may be involved in the attenuation of HSF1 activity during recovery leading to accelerated cytoplasmic localization of HSF1 (Wang X et al. 2003, 2004).In addition, stress stimulated human K562 erythroleukemia cells showed enhanced level of sumoylation in the HSF1 regulatory domain at Lys298, which was positively regulated by Ser303 phosphorylation (Hietakangas V et al. 2003)."

Wang et al. using the porcine receptor found that phosphorylation at any of the positions they examined (all conserved in humans) was sufficient for STAT5 phosphorylation. While STAT5 activation requires phosphorylation of the distal region of GHR, this has no effect on STAT1 or STAT3 activation (Yi et al. 1996) suggesting different mechanisms. Mutation of Y332 to F in a truncated form of GHR with only the first 54 residues of the cytoplasmic domain had no effect on JAK2 activation or cell proliferation presumed to be mediated by ERK (Wang et al. 1995) so the significance of phosphorylation at this position is unclear. SHP2 binds to Y595 of rat GHR (identical numbering in humans) and to a lesser extent Y487; mutation of these residues impairs the association (Stofega et al. 2000).

The released HSF1 monomer is rapidly converted to a homotrimer (Baler R et al. 1993; Herbomel G et al 2013). Upon trimerization HSF1 undergoes significant conformational changes resulting in an assembly of a stable triple-stranded alpha-helical coiled-coil structure with the amino-terminal hydrophobic domains from individual monomeric units (Rabindran SK et al. 1993; Zuo J et al. 1994, 1995; Neef DW et al. 2013). Biochemical and structural analysis strongly suggest that the monomer-to-trimer transition is tightly regulated at several interdependent levels. Thus, HSPs and cofactors bind HSF1 monomers preventing trimerization (Zou J et al.1998; Guo Y et al. 2001). In addition, leucine zippers (LZ) in the trimerization domain (LZ1-LZ3) are thought to retain HSF1 in its inactive monomeric form by intramolecular coiled-coil interactions with LZ4 in the carboxyl-terminus of HSF1, while LZ interactions between trimerization domains of individual monomeric units facilitate homotrimerization (Rabindran SK et al. 1993; Zuo J et al. 1994, 1995; Neef DW et al. 2013). HSF1 flexible linker region between DNA binding domain and first LZ of the trimerization domain was also found to modulate the monomer-trimer equilibrium (Liu PCC and Thiele DJ 1999). Furthermore, intermolecular disulfide bonds between cysteine residues 36 and 103 were reported to stabilize HSF1 trimer, while intramolecular disulfide crosslink inhibited HSF1 oligomerization (Lu M et al. 2008, 2009). Moreover, redox regulatory mechanisms were shown to regulate thiol-disulfide exchange and the conformation and activity of mammalian HSF1 in response to stress (Manalo DJ et al. 2002; Ahn SG and Thiele DJ 2003).<p>A ribonucleoprotein complex containing translation elongation factor EEF1A1 (eEF1A) and a long non-coding RNA, HSR1 (heat shock RNA-1) was shown to mediate trimerization of HSF1 (Shamovsky I et al. 2006)."	eEF1A;HSF12013	8	adds_modification	"The MSL complex has histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity with a high specificity for histone H4 lysine-17 (H4K16) (Smith et al. 2000, 2005, Conrad et al. 2012).

In eukaryotes the SPT-ADA-GCN5 acetyltransferase (SAGA) complex has 19 subunits including TRRAP, ENY2, USP22 and subunits belonging to the ADA, SPT, TAF, and SGF group of proteins (Nagy et al. 2009). The ADA2A-containing (ATAC) complex shares with SAGA a core composed of KAT2A-TADA3 (ADA3)-CCDC101 (STAF36, SGF29) and either TADA2A (ADA2a) in ATAC, or TADA2B (ADA2b) in SAGA. ATAC complexes contain a second putative HAT, called CSRP2BP (ATAC2), and five other subunits; YEATS2, ZZZ3, MBIP, WDR5, and DR1 (NC2-Beta) (Guelman et al. 2009). CSRP2BP has weak HAT activity in vitro but it's main function is to maintain the structural integrity of ATAC (Guelman et al. 2009). At present, the biological function of the ATAC complex is not well understood. In vitro GCN5 acetylates mainly histone H3K14 (lysine-15 in the UniProt peptide which retains the initiating methionine), but when incorporated into the SAGA complex GCN5 becomes more efficient as an H3K14 acetylase and can also acetylate H3K9 and H3K18 (Brand et al. 1999, Grant et al. 1999), H3K23, and H3K27 (Kuo et al. 1996, Kuo & Andrews 2013). Drosophila ATAC mainly acetylates histone H4 (Ciurciu et al. 2006, Suganuma et al. 2008), suggested to be due to the presence of CSRP2BP in the complex (Suganuma et al. 2008) but different human ATAC preparations have exhibited a range of specificities with no clear difference between SAGA and ATAC (Guelman et al. 2009, Wang et al. 2008, Nagy et al. 2010). SAGA and ATAC complexes from mouse and human contain either GCN5 or PCAF in a mutually exclusive manner (Nagy et al. 2010, Krebs et al. 2010, Spedale et al. 2012).<br><br>The SAGA complex consists of KAT2A (hGCN5), TADA1 (STAF42), TADA2B (ADA2b), TADA3 (STAF54, ADA3), SUPT3H (SPT3), SUPT7L (STAF65G), TAF5L (PAF65B), TAF6L (PAF65A), TAF9 (TAFII31), TAF12 (TAFII20), TAF10 (TAFII31), TRRAP, SAP130 (Martinez et al. 2001), CCDC101, ATXN7, a factor termed STAF55 that cannot be identified, two further factors described as probable members that cannot be identified STAF46 and STAF60 (Nagy & Tora 2007) plus ATXN7L3, USP22, ENY2 (Zhao et al. 2008) and SUPT20H (Nagy et al. 2009)."

ANKLE2 (LEM4) binds the PP2A complex that contains the B55-alpha regulatory subunit and facilitates BANF1 dephosphorylation, but as ANKLE2 does not interact with BANF1 (BAF) directly, the exact mechanism has not been determined (Asencio et al. 2012)."

These apo-carboxylases are biotinylated to their active halo forms by the activity of biotin-protein ligase (HCLS) (Ingaramo & Beckett 2012, Hiratsuka et al. 1998, Bailey et al. 2010). HCLS is localised to the cytosol and mitochondrion so can perform this activity in either of these locations. Defects in HLCS causes holocarboxylase synthetase deficiency (HLCS deficiency aka biotin-responsive multiple carboxylase deficiency; MIM:253270). HLCS deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder whereby deficient HLCS activity results in reduced activity of multiple carboxylases. Symptoms include metabolic acidosis, organic aciduria, lethargy, hypotonia, convulsions and dermatitis (Suzuki et al. 2005). Propionyl-CoA carboxylase is most likely functional as a dodecamer, composed of six Btn-containing alpha subunits (PCCA) and six beta subunits (PCCB).

Recruitment of HDAC3 to the DAD is essential for repression by the nuclear thyroid hormone receptor and for the maintenance of normal circadian physiology (You et al. 2010, Yin et al. 2007). A second SANT-like domain has been reported to interact directly with histone tails and termed the histone interaction domain (HID) (Hartman et al. 2005, Yu et al. 2003). NCORs are largely unstructured platform proteins that act as a scaffold upon which the enzymatic machinery of the repression complex is built (Watson et al. 2012). They can recruit other deacetylases such as HDAC4 (Fischle et al. 2002), HDAC5, HDAC7 (Kao et al. 2000), Sirt1 (Picard et al. 2004), and via mSin3, HDAC1 (Heinzel et al. 1997, Nagy et al. 1997). The importance of these deacetylase enzymes is not yet established. It has been demonstrated HDAC3 was shown to be responsible for deacetylase activities associated with HDAC4 and HDAC7 (Fischle et al. 2002). Corepressor complexes are heterogeneous, context-specific and transient in nature, but in addition to HDAC3, some additional partners are regularly found in stoichiometric association with NCOR1/NCOR2 and are essential for repressive function. These partners include the G protein pathway suppressor (GPS2) and transducing beta-like 1 (TBL1) and its homologue, TBL-related 1 (TBLR1), which together form the core repression complex (Oberoi et al. 2011).

This is achieved by ubiquitination of SCNN via E3 ubiquitin-protein ligases (NED4L and WPP1) (Staub et al. 2000, Farr et al. 2000).

The number of channels at the cell's surface (consequently its function) can be regulated. This is achieved by ubiquitination of SCNN via E3 ubiquitin-protein ligases (NED4L and WPP1) (Staub et al. 2000, Farr et al. 2000).

In rotary shadowing images TNC is seen as a symmetrical structure called a hexabrachion (Erickson & Iglesias 1984). This hexamer is formed from initial trimers (Kammerer et al. 1988). All members of the family are believed able to form trimers but only C, R and W have the extra cysteine required for form hexamers. All have amino-terminal heptad repeats, epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like repeats, fibronectin type III domain repeats, and a carboxyl-terminal fibrinogen-like globular domain (Hsia & Schwartzbauer 2005). TNC was the first of the family to be discovered and is the best characterised (Midwood et al. 2011). Its subunits vary greatly in size (between 190 and 330 kDa of the tenascin-C monomer) due to glycosylation and splicing isoforms (Joester & Faissner 1999). During embryonic development TNC is expressed in neural, skeletal, and vascular tissues. In adults it is detectable only in tendon and tissues undergoing remodeling processes such as wound repair and neovascularization, or in pathological processes such as inflammation and tumorigenesis. TNR forms dimers and trimers (Norenberg et al. 1992) and is expressed only in the developing and adult central nervous system. TNC and TNR-null mice (single and double knock-outs) have surprisingly normal gross phenotypes, but exhibit behavioural and wound healing abnormalities (Mackie & Tucker 1999, Montag-Sallaz & Montag 2003). TNX (termed tenascin-Y in chicken) is the largest member of the family and is widely expressed during development, but in adults is limited to musculoskeletal, cardiac, and dermal tissue. It can form trimers, though it lacks the amino-terminal cysteine residues involved in hexamer formation. It is clearly associated with a variant of a heritable connective tissue disorder known as Ehler-Danlos Syndrome, which is associated with fibrillar collagen defects (Burch et al. 1997, Mao et al. 2002). TNY is thought to be an avian orthologue of TNX (Chiquet-Ehrismann 2004). TNW, first identified in zebrafish (Weber et al. 1998), is the least well characterized member of the tenascin family. It forms trimers and is expressed in developing skeletal tissue, neural crest cells and kidney, a pattern that partially overlaps with TN-C. <br><br>TNC binds syndecan-3 (Salmivirta et al. 1991, Koyama et al. 1996) Syndecans are type I transmembrane proteins, with an N-terminal ectodomain that contains several consensus sequences for glycosaminoglycan attachment and a short C-terminal cytoplasmic domain. Syndecan-1 and -3 glycosaminoglycan attachment sites occur in two distinct clusters, one near the N-terminus and the other near the membrane-attachment site, separated by a proline and threonine-rich 'spacer'. Syndecan ectodomain sequences are poorly conserved in the family and between species, but the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains are highly conserved. Syndecan-1 and -3 form a subfamily. Syndecan-3 on the cell surface is frequently oligomeric (Asundi & Carey 1995).

There are conflicting reports regarding the requirement for the DVL PDZ domain in the WNT-dependent activation of RAC (Habas et al, 2003; Cajanek et al, 2013). Activation of RAC almost certainly involves a RAC-specific GEF activity, potentially associated with DVL. In dopaminergic neurons, TIAM1 has been identified as the GEF for WNT5a- and DVL-dependent activation of RAC (Cajanek et al, 2013), however it is not clear whether this is generally true in other cell types and for other WNT ligands. In some cases, RAC activation correlates with activation of the downstream effector c-Jun N terminal kinase (JNK). This is thought to regulate reorganization of the cytoskeleton, however the mechanism of JNK activation is unknown. In other cases, JNK activation appears to be dispensable to the WNT response (Yamanaka et al, 2002; Habas et al, 2003; Rosso et al, 2005; reviewed in Heaseman and Ridley, 2008; Lai et al, 2009)"	Dvl-1__pp-DVL3__pp-DVL2;RAC__GTP2013	8	binds	"DAAM1 (Dishevelled-associated activator of morphogenesis) is a formin-homology protein that was identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen for interactors with the DVL PDZ domain (Habas et al, 2001).

In the absence of a WNT signal, DAAM1 exists in a autoinhibited conformation mediated by an intramolecular interaction between the DBD and DAD regions (Habas et al, 2001; Liu et al, 2007). Upon WNT signaling, a direct interaction between the DAD of DAAM1 and the PDZ domain of DVL relieves the autoinhibition.

When the concentration of cAMP rises (e.g. as a result of adenylate cyclase activation by G protein-coupled receptors coupled to Gs, or inhibition of phosphodiesterases that degrade cAMP) cAMP binds to two binding sites on the regulatory subunits, leading to the release and activation of the catalytic subunits.

A-kinase anchor proteins (AKAPs) bind to the regulatory subunits and to cytoskeletal structures or membranes, anchoring the enzyme complex to a particular subcellular compartment. Dual-specificity A kinase-anchoring proteins (AKAP1/D-AKAP1) and (AKAP10/D-AKAP2) interact with the type I and type II regulatory subunits of PKA (Huang et al. 1997). AKAP10 additionally has two regulator of G-protein signaling (RGS) domains, giving it the potential to coordinate a signaling complex that links cAMP signaling with G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling (Burns-Hamuro et al. 2004)."

It is a critical organizer of postsynaptic differentiation at the skeletal neuromuscular junction; synaptogenesis is profoundly disrupted in its absence (Gautam et al. 1996, Daniels 2012). Two alternate N-termini exist with differential expression, tissue localization and function. The secreted and predominant longer LN form (Burgess et al. 2000) starts with a secretion signal sequence and a laminin-binding domain (Denzer et al. 1995, Kammerer et al. 1999); the shorter SN form associates with the plasma membrane (Burgess et al. 2000, Neumann et al. 2001). Following the SN or LN regions are 8 follistatin repeats, known to bind growth factors and inhibit proteases in other proteins. The central region has two repeats homologous to domain III of laminin. The C-terminal portion, which is responsible for the molecule's known signaling functions, contains four EGF repeats and three LG (G) domains homologous to those found in laminin alpha chains, neurexins and slits (Timpl et al. 2000). <br><br>The LG domains of AGRN bind alpha-dystroglycan (Yamada et al. 1996, Gee et al. 1994, Bowen et al. 1996, Campanelli et al. 1996, Gesemann et al. 1996, Hopf & Hoch 1996)."
