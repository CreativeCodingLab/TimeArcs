We introduce *TimeArcs*, a novel visualization technique for representing the dynamic relationships between entities in a network. In many application domains, relationships between entities are not temporally stable, which means that cluster structures and cluster memberships also may vary across time. Our technique provides a big picture overview of the most significant clusters over time. *TimeArcs* also supports a range of interactive features, such as allowing users to drill-down in order to see details about a particular cluster. To highlight the benefits of this technique, we demonstrate its application to various datasets, including the collocated popular phrases obtained from political blogs, IMDB co-star network, and  a dataset showing conflicting evidences within biomedical literature of protein interactions.
