The data is available on [IMDB website](http://www.imdb.com/interfaces). We went through 9,963 movies rated 8 stars or higher from 1955 to 2014 across three genres: comedy, action, and drama. In total, our dataset contained 66,182 actors. Fig.~\ref{fig:IMDB} shows \textit{TimeArcs} for the top 200 actors. In particular, the arcs connect co-actors in the same movies. In this use case, we color the arcs by movie genres: green for comedy, red for action, blue for drama. \textit{TimeArcs} helps viewers to quickly identify temporal communities of actors. Each horizontal line represents one actor and connects his or her first through last appearances in highly rated movies. This helps to highlight actors with long careers and many good movies, such as, for example, the voice actor Michael Bell (at the red arrow in Fig~\ref{fig:IMDB}). The horizontal lines can be replaced by CloudLines-style graphs on demand. By brushing any actors' name, we can immediately visualize his or her co-star network to see how it changes over time.
