2010	8	adds_modification	RIP2 induces the K63-linked ubiquitination of NEMO at K285 and K399, positively modulating subsequent NF-kappaB activation (Abbot et al. 2007). TRAF6 E3 ligase is capable of performing this ubiquitination step when overexpressed in HEK239 cells, and this effect is blocked if RIP2 siRNA is co-transfected, but small interfering RNA (siRNA) experiments indicate that there are additional E3 ligases that can substitute for TRAF6 in NEMO ubiquitination. In addition to TRAF6, the K63-specific E2 ligase Ubc13 is required for NEMO ubiquitination suggesting a common mechanism for NEMO ubiquitination in NOD and TLR signaling.	TRAF6;NEMO
2011	8	removes_modification	Peroxiredoxin AhpC gets its reducing equivalents through a cascade of proteins via AhpD, a disulfide reductase, DlaT, a lipoylated disulfide reductase, and, finally, from Lpd, the NADH-dependent dihydrolipoyl reductase. The latter two are also part of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (Venugopal et al. 2011).	dlaT;ahpD
2012	8	adds_modification	SLP-76 lacks intrinsic catalytic activity and acts as a scaffold, recruiting other proteins for correct localization during molecular signal transduction (Bogin et al. 2007). Activation of FCERI leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of SLP-76 (Gross et al. 1999). SLP-76 has three potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites within its amino terminus region: Y113, Y128, and Y145. Phosphorylation may be mediated by SYK, analogous to the role of ZAP-70 in phosphorylating T-cell SLP-76 (Bubeck-Wardenberg et al. 1996).	p-6Y-SYK;LCP2
2012	8	adds_modification	BTK/ITK are activated in a two step model. In the first step they are recruited to the membrane by binding to PIP3 or, alternatively with other binding partners like SLP-76. Once at the membrane SYK or Src-kinases in the vicinity phosphorylates Y551 (Y512 in ITK) in the activation loop of the catalytic domain of BTK to fully activate it (Rawlings et al. 1996, Park et al. 1996, Kawakami et al. 1994).	p-6Y-SYK;TEC

2012	8	adds_modification	SHC is an adapter protein that has been implicated in Ras activation. Mast cells express two isoforms of 46 and 52 kDa. Both isoforms of SHC have two domains, an N-terminal phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain and a C-terminal SH2 domain that allows Shc to bind to proteins containing phosphorylated tyrosine residues. Following receptor stimulation, SHC is phosphorylated by Src kinases Syk on Y239, Y240 and Y317 (p56 isoform). Both phosphotyrosines Y239 and Y317 creates the binding site for the SH2 domain of GRB2.	p-6Y-SYK;SHC1
2012	8	adds_modification	NTAL and LAT play complementary roles in the positive regulation of FCERI-mediated degranulation. Upon FCERI aggregation NTAL is phosphorylated by LYN, SYK and KIT on different tyrosines. Phosphorylated NTAL likely contributes to the activation of mast cells by providing docking sites for the recruitment of critical signaling molecules into the lipid raft. There are about ten tyrosines in LAT2 of which five tyrosines principally phosphorylated by SYK are recognised as putative GRB2-binding sites, being part of a YXN motif, whereas LYN and KIT phosphorylate both tyrosines contained in the YXN motifs as well as tyrosines outside of the YXN motifs (Iwaki et al. 2008).	p-6Y-SYK;NTAL
2012	8	adds_modification	LAT is palmitoylated and membrane-associated adaptor protein. It rapidly becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated upon receptor engagement. LAT has nine conserved tyrosine residues of which five have been shown to undergo phosphorylation (Y127, Y132, Y171, Y191 and Y226). Src family kinases, SYK and ZAP-70 efficiently phosphorylate LAT on these tyrosine residues (Jiang & Cheng 2007, Paz et al. 2001). Phosphorylation of LAT creates binding sites for the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain proteins PLC-gamma1, GRB2 and GADS, which indirectly bind SOS, VAV, SLP-76 and ITK (Wange 2000).	p-6Y-SYK;LAT

2005	8	removes_modification	Phosphorylation of IRAK-1 is due to three sequential phosphorylation steps, which leads to full or hyper-phopshorylation of IRAK1. Under in vitro conditions these are all autophosphorylation events. First, Thr-209 is phosphorylated resulting in a conformational change of the kinase domain. Next, Thr-387 in the activation loop is phosphorylated, leading to full enzymatic activity. Several additional residues are phosphorylated in the proline-, serine-, and threonine-rich (ProST) region between the N-terminal death domain and kinase domain. Hyperphosphorylation of this region leads to dissociation of IRAK1 from the activated receptor complex.

BTK-specific inhibitor, LFM-A13, blocked the phosphorylation of TIRAP in human monocytic cell line THP-1 stimulated with LPS or macrophage-activating lipopeptide-2 (MALP-2) (Gray P et al. 2006). LFM-A13 also inhibited activation of NFkappaB in LPS-treated THP-1 (Jefferies CA et al. 2003). Besides BTK kinase TIRAP was shown to associate with other kinases such as protein kinase C delta (PKC delta) suggesting their regulatory role in TIRAP activation (Kubo-Murai M et al. 2007).<p>Tyr-86, Tyr-106 and Tyr-187 were identified as possible phosphorylation sites (Gray P et al. 2006). An additional study has shown that Tyr-86, Tyr-106, and Tyr-159 are important residues, as mutagenesis of these residues impaired TIRAP (MAL) phosphorylation, affected its interaction with BTK and also impaired downstream signaling (Piao W et al. 2008). BTK-mediated phosphorylation of TIRAP leads to recruitment of suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1), which assembles K48-linked polyubiquitin chains resulting in TIRAP's proteosomal degradation, disrupting the TLR complex, and terminating signaling (Mansell A et al. 2006). TIRAP function is also regulated by the cysteine protease caspase-1, which cleaves the protein in a region of the molecule that interacts with MyD88 and TLR4 (Ulrichts P et al. 2010).

The details of the docking and priming recation have been worked out using synaptic vesicle loaded with glutamate and similar reactions may occur during the transport cycle of noradrenaline. The vesicle is held in close apposition to the plasma membrane by several proteins that bridge the synaptic vesicle to the plasma membrane. Some of these proteins are in the plasma membrane while others are in the synaptic vesicle. Vesicle fusion is preceded by a priming event where molecular interactions between the docked vesicle and the plasma membrane undergo changes. The molecules in the docking and the priming process are known, however, the exact sequence and the precise molecular changes involved in docking and priming are not well dissected. In this reaction the process of docking and priming has been condensed. It is known that Munc18 along with its interactors is critical for membrane docking and fusion events while Munc 13 along with its interacting proteins is central to priming. Munc 13 could act as a positive regulator for the priming recation. Finally the primed fusion complex is clamped in the pre-fusion form by a Complexin.

2010	8	translocation	TRAF6 possesses ubiquitin ligase activity and undergoes K-63-linked auto-ubiquitination after its oligomerization. In the first step, ubiquitin is activated by an E1 ubiquitin activating enzyme. The activated ubiquitin is transferred to a E2 conjugating enzyme (a heterodimer of proteins Ubc13 and Uev1A) forming the E2-Ub thioester. Finally, in the presence of ubiquitin-protein ligase E3 (TRAF6, a RING-domain E3), ubiquitin is attached to the target protein (TRAF6 on residue Lysine 124) through an isopeptide bond between the C-terminus of ubiquitin and the epsilon-amino group of a lysine residue in the target protein. In contrast to K-48-linked ubiquitination that leads to the proteosomal degradation of the target protein, K-63-linked polyubiquitin chains act as a scaffold to assemble protein kinase complexes and mediate their activation through proteosome-independent mechanisms. This K63 polyubiquitinated TRAF6 activates the TAK1 kinase complex.	TRAF6;IRAK1

2010	8	removes_modification	SMG6 endonucleolytically cleaves an mRNA it is believed that the resulting fragments are degraded by exonucleases, possibly XRN1, a 5'-to-3' nuclease, and the exosome complex, a 3'-to-5' nuclease (Huntzinger et al. 2008, Eberle et al. 2009). Inhibition of XRN1 is observed to cause accumulation of SMG6-cleaved intermediates therefore XRN1 is postulated to act downstream of SMG6 (Huntzinger et al. 2008).<br>In general, during Nonsense-Mediated Decay mRNAs are observed to be deadenlyated (implicating the PAN2 complex, PARN complex, and CCR4 complex), decapped (implicating the DCP1:DCP2 complex), and exoribonucleolytically digested (implicating the XRN1 5'-to-3' exonuclease and exosome 3'-to-5' exonuclease) (Lykke-Andersen 2002, Chen et al. 2003, Lejeune et al. 2003, Couttet and Grange 2004, Unterholzner and Izaurralde 2004, Yamashita et al. 2005). UPF1 is observed to associate with the decapping enzymes DCP1a and DCP2, however the specific decay reactions that occur after SMG6, SMG5 and SMG7 have associated with an mRNA are unknown (Lykke-Andersen et al. 2002). Likewise, SMG6 may be present in complexes separate from SMG5 and SMG7 and these complexes may have different routes of decay (reviewed in Nicholson et al. 2010, Muhlemann and Lykke-Andersen 2010).<br>ATPase activity of UPF1 is necessary for NMD and may reflect ATP-dependent helicase activity that disassembles the mRNA-protein complex (Franks et al. 2010). UPF1 must be dephosphorylated by PP2A for NMD to continue (Ohnishi et al. 2003, Chiu et al. 2003). Presumably the dephosphoryation recycles UPF1 for interaction with other mRNA complexes.

ANKLE2 (LEM4) binds the PP2A complex that contains the B55-alpha regulatory subunit and facilitates BANF1 dephosphorylation, but as ANKLE2 does not interact with BANF1 (BAF) directly, the exact mechanism has not been determined (Asencio et al. 2012).

2013	8	adds_modification	NEK9 serine residues S29, S750 and S869, which are likely targets of CDK1:CCNB-mediated phosphorylation in mitosis, can be recognized by the polo-box domain (PBD) of PLK1 when phosphorylated. Phosphorylation of S869 appears to be crucial for the interaction of NEK9 and PLK1 (Bertran et al. 2011). PLK1 phosphorylates threonine T210 of NEK9 in vitro. T210 is located in the kinase activation loop of NEK9 and T210 phosphorylation is necessary for NEK9 kinase activity. While T210 can be autophosphorylated in vitro, when NEK9 is incubated in the presence of excess ATP and Mg2+ (Roig et al. 2005), mitotic phosphorylation of T210 requires both CDK1 and PLK1 activity (Bertran et al. 2011).

2004	8	adds_modification	Prior to anaphase onset, sister-chromatids are held together by cohesin complexes distributed along chromosomal arms and at centromeres. In prometaphase, PLK1, likely recruited to cohesin complexes by binding to CDK1-phosphorylated CDCA5 (Sororin) (Zhang et al. 2011), phosphorylates cohesin subunits STAG2 (SA2) and RAD21 (Hauf et al. 2005). PLK1-mediated phosphorylation of cohesin subunits at centromeres is counteracted by the phosphatase activity of PP2A complex (containing the regulatory subunit B56 i.e. PPP2R5), which is recruited to the kinetochore by shugoshin proteins, SGOL1 and SGOL2 (Kitajima et al. 2006). Therefore, while cohesin complexes dissociate from chromosomal arms in prometaphase (Hauf et al. 2001), they remain bound to centromeres until anaphase onset (Hauf et al. 2001, Hauf et al. 2005, Kitajima et al. 2006). When separase is activated after its inhibitor securin is degraded by APC/C at the onset of anaphase, RAD21 is cleaved by separase. Phosphorylation of RAD21 by PLK1 facilitates subsequent cleavage of RAD21 by separase (Hauf et al. 2005). There are several potential PLK1 phosphorylation sites in STAG2 and RAD21, but the exact positions of in vivo phosphorylation of STAG2 and RAD21 by PLK1 have not been explicitly established (Hauf et al. 2005).

CARMA1 is a scaffold protein and recruits BCL10, MALT1, PKC and TRAF6 to form a multi protein complex. CARMA1 exists in an inactive conformation in which the linker region binds to and blocks the accessibility of the CARD motif. Upon stimulation S552 and S645 linker residues are phosphorylated by PKC-theta and this may weaken this interaction, inducing an open conformation of CARMA1. Further phosphorylation studies have revealed other phosphorylation sites (S109, S551 and S555) that may also promote activation of CARMA1. Serene/threonine kinases PKC-beta, IKKbeta, HPK1 and CaMKII are involved in triggering CARMA1 activation (Thome et al. 2010, Rueda & Thome 2005).

Photoactivated rhodopsin (MII or R*) catalyzes the exchange of GTP for GDP bound to Gt.

MII proceeds to activate additional Gt molecules, making this reaction the first amplification step in the phototransduction cascade.

2013	8	adds_modification	When the gamma-secretase complex is inhibited, the transmembrane fragment of NOTCH1 HD domain mutants that corresponds in size to ADAM10/17 cleavage product NEXT1 accumulates in treated cells.

Therefore, NOTCH1 HD domain mutants, although capable of and responsive to ligand binding, are constitutively active because of S2 site cleavage by ADAM10/17 in the absence of ligand. The constitutive S2 site cleavage of NOTCH1 HD domain mutants could be due to their altered conformation or due to increased rate of spontaneous dissociation of NOTCH1 extracellular and transmembrane subunits (Malecki et al. 2006).

Therefore, NOTCH1 HD domain mutants, although capable of and responsive to ligand binding, are constitutively active because of S2 site cleavage by ADAM10/17 in the absence of ligand. The constitutive S2 site cleavage of NOTCH1 HD domain mutants could be due to their altered conformation or due to increased rate of spontaneous dissociation of NOTCH1 extracellular and transmembrane subunits (Malecki et al. 2006). Both of these scenarios could make the S2 site constitutively accessible to ADAM10/17, but the exact mechanism has not been established.	Zn2+__ADAM10/17;UBC

Mutations of GHR predicted to disable a conformational change brought about by GH binding impaired ERK signaling but not JAK2/STAT5 signaling. ERK signaling was demonstrated to involve the Src family kinase Lyn (Rowlinson et al. 2008) and suggested to involve Src kinase dependent activation of Phospholipase C gamma and thereby Ras, similar to a mechanism proposed by Bivona et al. (2003). ERK activation mechanisms involving Src kinases and PLCgamma have been reported for the erythropoietin, thrombopoietin and prolactin receptors (Brooks & Waters 2010).	LYN;MK01

2008	8	adds_modification	Insulin-containing secretory granules are bound to Myosin Va via Rab27a in a complex of uncertain composition. Myosin Va moves along the cortical actin network (actin at the periphery of the cytoplasm), carrying the granules to the inner surface of the plasma membrane. A beta cell contains about 10 000 secretory granules. Of these, about 1000 are docked at the inner surface of the plasma membrane and a subset of about 100 docked granules form the "readily releasable" pool (granules which are released within about 5 minutes of glucose stimulation). Docking occurs by interaction between EXOC3/Sec6 located on the membrane of the secretory granule and EXOC4/Sec8 located at the plasma membrane.

2014	8	adds_modification	Autoproteolytic processing of the Hh precursor is essential for the production of active secreted Hh ligand and mutants that disrupt this processing have been identified in the congenital nervous system disorder holoprosencephaly (Traiffort et al, 2004; Maity et al, 2005; Roessler et al, 2009; reviewed in Jiang et al, 2008). Cleavage of Hh occurs through two nucleophilic substitutions. The first step is mediated by the catalytic cysteine residue, which is found in a conserved G-C-F motif. The cysteine side chain attacks the carbonyl carbon of the main peptide chain between the glycine and cysteine residues, replacing the amino group in the peptide backbone with a thioester linkage (Lee et al, 1994; Porter et al, 1995; Porter et al, 1996a, b; Chen et al, 2011). The second step involves nucleophilic attack of the same carbonyl group by cholesterol. This step displaces the C-terminal fragment (Hh-C) of the Hh precursor and results in the formation of the N-terminal fragment (Hh-Np) modified at its C-terminus by an ester linkage with cholesterol (Porter et al, 1996a, b; Chen et al, 2011). Cholesterol modification appears to contribute to further processing and trafficking of the Hh ligand, as engineered forms of vertebrate and fly Hh that lack cholesterol are not efficiently palmitoylated (Pepinsky et al, 1998). Cholesterol also restricts the diffusion of the secreted ligand by interacting with the lipid bilayer of the secreting cell. Consistent with this, aberrant activation of Hh target genes is seen in the absence of cholesterol modification (Peters et al, 2004; Guerrero et al, 2007; Li et al, 2006; Huang et al, 2007).<br>	PDI__NglycoAsn-Hh precursors;SHH

2012	8	adds_modification	The binding of SYK to DAP12 induces conformational changes that result in SYK activation. Around ten autophosporylated tyrosine residues have been identified in SYK, regulating activity and serving as docking sites for other proteins. Sites include Y131 of interdomain A, Y323, Y348, and Y352 of interdomain B, Y525 and Y526 within the activation loop of the kinase domain and Y630 in the C-terminus (Zhang et al. 2002, Lupher et al. 1998, Furlong et al. 1997). <br><br>SYK is phosphorylated by Src family kinases and this acts as an initiating trigger by generating a few molecules of activated SYK, which then initiate SYK autophosphorylation (Hillal et al. 1997, Castro et al. 2010)	SYK;KSYK
2003	8	removes_modification	Protein phosphatase 2A removes the phosphates from phosphorylated rhodopsin (p MII) and phosphorylated opsin (p-RHO) (Fowles et al. 1989, Palczewski et al. 1989a,b). A Ca2+ dependent opsin phosphatase is also present (Kutuzov & Bennett 1996). Serine/threonine protein phosphatases with EF hands (PPEF1 and 2) that share homology with Drosophila retinal degeneration C (rdgC) are expressed in retina and may be responsible (Huang & Honkanen 1998), there is no evidence for a physiological role in dephosphorylating rhodopsin. Once dephosphorylated, RHO can once again bind the chromophore 11 cis retinal (11cRAL), in readiness for the next photon response. Arrestin (S-antigen or SAG, Yamaki et al. 1988) binds to and sterically caps MII, preventing PPEF1 from dephosphorylating it.	PP7__Mg2+;OPSD
2010	8	adds_modification	Collagen was for many years considered the only source of 4-hydroxyproline (4-Hyp) in animals. Though it is now known that other proteins such as C1q and elastin also contain 4-Hyp, collagen is by far the major source (Adams & Frank 1980). 4-Hyp is required for collagen stability at physiological temperatures. The abundance of Hyp in animal proteins is ~4%, making it more abundant than the amino-acids Cys, Gln, His, Met, Phe, Trp and Tyr (McCaldon & Argos 1988). In collagen Hyp abundance is much higher at ~38% (Ramshaw et al. 1998). Full collagen proline hydroxylation significantly raises the melting temperature (Tm) by stabilizing the collagen triple helix (Berg & Prockop 1973a), a process that has been studied extensively using synthetic collagen peptides (Sakakibara et al. 1973, Holmgren et al. 1998) and is well understood at the structural level (Shoulders & Raines 2009). Collagen 4-Hyp content is relatively stable, with small differences between collagen types. Collagen type I has approximately 1 4-Hyp for every 10 residues, roughly 50% of available prolines (Kivirikko et al. 1992). Conversion of Pro to (2S,4R)-4-hydroxyproline (4-Hyp) is the most prevalent posttranslational modification in humans, catalyzed by prolyl 4-hydroxylase (P4H). Mammalian prolyl 4-hydroxylase is an alpha2 beta2 tetramer (Berg & Prockop 1973b). The 59-kDa alpha subunit contains the substrate-binding domain and the enzymic active site (Helaakoski et al. 1989). Humans and most other vertebrates have three isoforms of the alpha subunit, isoform alpha-1 is the most prevalent. The pair of alpha subunits can be any of the three isoforms (Gorres & Raines 2010). The 55-kDa beta subunit is protein disulphide isomerase (PDI), which has additional functions in collagen formation. As part of P4H it retains the tetramer in the ER lumen and maintains the otherwise insoluble alpha subunit in an active form (Vuori et al. 1992, Nietfeld & Kemp 1981). P4H is a member of the non-heme iron(II), alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase family. Molecular oxygen (O2), 2-oxoglutarate (alpha-ketoglutarate) and iron(II) are required for its activity (Hutton & Udenfriend 1966). During the reaction, alpha-ketoglutarate is oxidatively decarboxylated producing succinate and CO2 (Rhoads & Udenfriend 1968, Gorres & Raines 2010). Ascorbate is required as a cofactor but not consumed (Kivirikko et al 1989). The minimum substrate required for hydroxylation is an Xaa-Pro-Gly tripeptide, with Pro preferred in the Xaa position, though hydroxylation can occur at lower rates with a variety of residues at this position (Kivirikko et al. 1972). A number of other peptides, notably elastin, are substrates for P4H (Bhatnagar 1978).<br><br>For brevity, all forms of collagen propeptide are shown as having 3X 4-Hyp residues following the action of P4H.

2010	8	adds_modification	Collagen was for many years considered the only source of 4-hydroxyproline (4-Hyp) in animals. Though it is now known that other proteins such as C1q and elastin also contain 4-Hyp, collagen is by far the major source (Adams & Frank 1980). 4-Hyp is required for collagen stability at physiological temperatures. The abundance of Hyp in animal proteins is ~4%, making it more abundant than the amino-acids Cys, Gln, His, Met, Phe, Trp and Tyr (McCaldon & Argos 1988). In collagen Hyp abundance is much higher at ~38% (Ramshaw et al. 1998). Full collagen proline hydroxylation significantly raises the melting temperature (Tm) by stabilizing the collagen triple helix (Berg & Prockop 1973a), a process that has been studied extensively using synthetic collagen peptides (Sakakibara et al. 1973, Holmgren et al. 1998) and is well understood at the structural level (Shoulders & Raines 2009). Collagen 4-Hyp content is relatively stable, with small differences between collagen types. Collagen type I has approximately 1 4-Hyp for every 10 residues, roughly 50% of available prolines (Kivirikko et al. 1992). Conversion of Pro to (2S,4R)-4-hydroxyproline (4-Hyp) is the most prevalent posttranslational modification in humans, catalyzed by prolyl 4-hydroxylase (P4H). Mammalian prolyl 4-hydroxylase is an alpha2 beta2 tetramer (Berg & Prockop 1973b). The 59-kDa alpha subunit contains the substrate-binding domain and the enzymic active site (Helaakoski et al. 1989). Humans and most other vertebrates have three isoforms of the alpha subunit, isoform alpha-1 is the most prevalent. The pair of alpha subunits can be any of the three isoforms (Gorres & Raines 2010). The 55-kDa beta subunit is protein disulphide isomerase (PDI), which has additional functions in collagen formation. As part of P4H it retains the tetramer in the ER lumen and maintains the otherwise insoluble alpha subunit in an active form (Vuori et al. 1992, Nietfeld & Kemp 1981). P4H is a member of the non-heme iron(II), alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase family. Molecular oxygen (O2), 2-oxoglutarate (alpha-ketoglutarate) and iron(II) are required for its activity (Hutton & Udenfriend 1966). During the reaction, alpha-ketoglutarate is oxidatively decarboxylated producing succinate and CO2 (Rhoads & Udenfriend 1968, Gorres & Raines 2010). Ascorbate is required as a cofactor but not consumed (Kivirikko et al 1989).

Collagen 4-Hyp content is relatively stable, with small differences between collagen types. Collagen type I has approximately 1 4-Hyp for every 10 residues, roughly 50% of available prolines (Kivirikko et al. 1992). Conversion of Pro to (2S,4R)-4-hydroxyproline (4-Hyp) is the most prevalent posttranslational modification in humans, catalyzed by prolyl 4-hydroxylase (P4H). Mammalian prolyl 4-hydroxylase is an alpha2 beta2 tetramer (Berg & Prockop 1973b). The 59-kDa alpha subunit contains the substrate-binding domain and the enzymic active site (Helaakoski et al. 1989). Humans and most other vertebrates have three isoforms of the alpha subunit, isoform alpha-1 is the most prevalent. The pair of alpha subunits can be any of the three isoforms (Gorres & Raines 2010). The 55-kDa beta subunit is protein disulphide isomerase (PDI), which has additional functions in collagen formation. As part of P4H it retains the tetramer in the ER lumen and maintains the otherwise insoluble alpha subunit in an active form (Vuori et al. 1992, Nietfeld & Kemp 1981). P4H is a member of the non-heme iron(II), alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase family. Molecular oxygen (O2), 2-oxoglutarate (alpha-ketoglutarate) and iron(II) are required for its activity (Hutton & Udenfriend 1966). During the reaction, alpha-ketoglutarate is oxidatively decarboxylated producing succinate and CO2 (Rhoads & Udenfriend 1968, Gorres & Raines 2010). Ascorbate is required as a cofactor but not consumed (Kivirikko et al 1989). The minimum substrate required for hydroxylation is an Xaa-Pro-Gly tripeptide, with Pro preferred in the Xaa position, though hydroxylation can occur at lower rates with a variety of residues at this position (Kivirikko et al. 1972). A number of other peptides, notably elastin, are substrates for P4H (Bhatnagar 1978).<br><br>For brevity, all forms of collagen propeptide are shown as having 3X 4-Hyp residues following the action of P4H.

Though it is now known that other proteins such as C1q and elastin also contain 4-Hyp, collagen is by far the major source (Adams & Frank 1980). 4-Hyp is required for collagen stability at physiological temperatures. The abundance of Hyp in animal proteins is ~4%, making it more abundant than the amino-acids Cys, Gln, His, Met, Phe, Trp and Tyr (McCaldon & Argos 1988).

As part of P4H it retains the tetramer in the ER lumen and maintains the otherwise insoluble alpha subunit in an active form (Vuori et al. 1992, Nietfeld & Kemp 1981). P4H is a member of the non-heme iron(II), alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase family. Molecular oxygen (O2), 2-oxoglutarate (alpha-ketoglutarate) and iron(II) are required for its activity (Hutton & Udenfriend 1966). During the reaction, alpha-ketoglutarate is oxidatively decarboxylated producing succinate and CO2 (Rhoads & Udenfriend 1968, Gorres & Raines 2010). Ascorbate is required as a cofactor but not consumed (Kivirikko et al 1989). The minimum substrate required for hydroxylation is an Xaa-Pro-Gly tripeptide, with Pro preferred in the Xaa position, though hydroxylation can occur at lower rates with a variety of residues at this position (Kivirikko et al. 1972). A number of other peptides, notably elastin, are substrates for P4H (Bhatnagar 1978).<br><br>For brevity, all forms of collagen propeptide are shown as having 3X 4-Hyp residues following the action of P4H.

Though it is now known that other proteins such as C1q and elastin also contain 4-Hyp, collagen is by far the major source (Adams & Frank 1980). 4-Hyp is required for collagen stability at physiological temperatures. The abundance of Hyp in animal proteins is ~4%, making it more abundant than the amino-acids Cys, Gln, His, Met, Phe, Trp and Tyr (McCaldon & Argos 1988). In collagen Hyp abundance is much higher at ~38% (Ramshaw et al. 1998). Full collagen proline hydroxylation significantly raises the melting temperature (Tm) by stabilizing the collagen triple helix (Berg & Prockop 1973a), a process that has been studied extensively using synthetic collagen peptides (Sakakibara et al. 1973, Holmgren et al. 1998) and is well understood at the structural level (Shoulders & Raines 2009). Collagen 4-Hyp content is relatively stable, with small differences between collagen types. Collagen type I has approximately 1 4-Hyp for every 10 residues, roughly 50% of available prolines (Kivirikko et al. 1992). Conversion of Pro to (2S,4R)-4-hydroxyproline (4-Hyp) is the most prevalent posttranslational modification in humans, catalyzed by prolyl 4-hydroxylase (P4H). Mammalian prolyl 4-hydroxylase is an alpha2 beta2 tetramer (Berg & Prockop 1973b). The 59-kDa alpha subunit contains the substrate-binding domain and the enzymic active site (Helaakoski et al. 1989).

2010	8	adds_modification	Collagen was for many years considered the only source of 4-hydroxyproline (4-Hyp) in animals. Though it is now known that other proteins such as C1q and elastin also contain 4-Hyp, collagen is by far the major source (Adams & Frank 1980). 4-Hyp is required for collagen stability at physiological temperatures. The abundance of Hyp in animal proteins is ~4%, making it more abundant than the amino-acids Cys, Gln, His, Met, Phe, Trp and Tyr (McCaldon & Argos 1988). In collagen Hyp abundance is much higher at ~38% (Ramshaw et al. 1998). Full collagen proline hydroxylation significantly raises the melting temperature (Tm) by stabilizing the collagen triple helix (Berg & Prockop 1973a), a process that has been studied extensively using synthetic collagen peptides (Sakakibara et al. 1973, Holmgren et al. 1998) and is well understood at the structural level (Shoulders & Raines 2009). Collagen 4-Hyp content is relatively stable, with small differences between collagen types. Collagen type I has approximately 1 4-Hyp for every 10 residues, roughly 50% of available prolines (Kivirikko et al. 1992). Conversion of Pro to (2S,4R)-4-hydroxyproline (4-Hyp) is the most prevalent posttranslational modification in humans, catalyzed by prolyl 4-hydroxylase (P4H). Mammalian prolyl 4-hydroxylase is an alpha2 beta2 tetramer (Berg & Prockop 1973b). The 59-kDa alpha subunit contains the substrate-binding domain and the enzymic active site (Helaakoski et al. 1989). Humans and most other vertebrates have three isoforms of the alpha subunit, isoform alpha-1 is the most prevalent. The pair of alpha subunits can be any of the three isoforms (Gorres & Raines 2010). The 55-kDa beta subunit is protein disulphide isomerase (PDI), which has additional functions in collagen formation. As part of P4H it retains the tetramer in the ER lumen and maintains the otherwise insoluble alpha subunit in an active form (Vuori et al. 1992, Nietfeld & Kemp 1981). P4H is a member of the non-heme iron(II), alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase family. Molecular oxygen (O2), 2-oxoglutarate (alpha-ketoglutarate) and iron(II) are required for its activity (Hutton & Udenfriend 1966). During the reaction, alpha-ketoglutarate is oxidatively decarboxylated producing succinate and CO2 (Rhoads & Udenfriend 1968, Gorres & Raines 2010). Ascorbate is required as a cofactor but not consumed (Kivirikko et al 1989).

Collagen 4-Hyp content is relatively stable, with small differences between collagen types. Collagen type I has approximately 1 4-Hyp for every 10 residues, roughly 50% of available prolines (Kivirikko et al. 1992). Conversion of Pro to (2S,4R)-4-hydroxyproline (4-Hyp) is the most prevalent posttranslational modification in humans, catalyzed by prolyl 4-hydroxylase (P4H). Mammalian prolyl 4-hydroxylase is an alpha2 beta2 tetramer (Berg & Prockop 1973b). The 59-kDa alpha subunit contains the substrate-binding domain and the enzymic active site (Helaakoski et al. 1989). Humans and most other vertebrates have three isoforms of the alpha subunit, isoform alpha-1 is the most prevalent. The pair of alpha subunits can be any of the three isoforms (Gorres & Raines 2010). The 55-kDa beta subunit is protein disulphide isomerase (PDI), which has additional functions in collagen formation. As part of P4H it retains the tetramer in the ER lumen and maintains the otherwise insoluble alpha subunit in an active form (Vuori et al. 1992, Nietfeld & Kemp 1981). P4H is a member of the non-heme iron(II), alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase family. Molecular oxygen (O2), 2-oxoglutarate (alpha-ketoglutarate) and iron(II) are required for its activity (Hutton & Udenfriend 1966). During the reaction, alpha-ketoglutarate is oxidatively decarboxylated producing succinate and CO2 (Rhoads & Udenfriend 1968, Gorres & Raines 2010). Ascorbate is required as a cofactor but not consumed (Kivirikko et al 1989). The minimum substrate required for hydroxylation is an Xaa-Pro-Gly tripeptide, with Pro preferred in the Xaa position, though hydroxylation can occur at lower rates with a variety of residues at this position (Kivirikko et al. 1972). A number of other peptides, notably elastin, are substrates for P4H (Bhatnagar 1978).<br><br>For brevity, all forms of collagen propeptide are shown as having 3X 4-Hyp residues following the action of P4H.

Because the binding of GNAT1-GTP to PDE-gamma is one to one, there is no amplification associated with this step. Active Gt alpha (GNAT-GTP) can be inactivated by a slow, intrinsic GTPase activity that hydrolyses GTP to GDP. Once GNAT1 has GDP bound, it no longer binds to the gamma subunit of PDE6 (PDE6-gamma) that then resumes inhibition of the catalytic subunit of PDE6.

2012	8	translocation	TLR3/4 signaling component were shown to mediate apoptosis in various human cell lines in the FADD:caspasse-8-dependent manner [Kalai M et al 2002; Kaiser WJ and Offermann MK 2005; Estornes Y et al 2012]. Caspase-8 zymogens (procaspase-8) are present in the cells as inactive monomers, containing a large N-terminal prodomain with two death effector domains (DED), and a C-terminal catalytic subunit composed of small and a large domains separated by a smaller linker region [Donepudi M et al 2003; Keller N et al 2009]. Dimerization is required for caspase-8 activation [Donepudi M et al 2003]. The dimerization event occurs at the receptor signaling complex. Once dimerized, caspase-8 zymogen undergoes a series of autoproteolytic cleavage events at aspartic acid residues in their interdomain linker regions. A second cleavage event between the the N-terminal prodomain and the catalytic domain releases the active caspase from the activation complex into the cytosol. The resulting fully active enzyme is a homodimer of catalytic domains, where each domain is compsed of a large p18 and a small p10 subunit [Keller N et al 2009; Oberst A et al 2010].

2006	8	translocation	alpha-secretase (ADAM17) is a metalloprotese that has the ability to cleave the p75NTR extracellular domain, in proximity of the transmembrane region. The cleaved extracellular domain is shed from the cell membrane, whereas the rest of the protein, the C-terminal fragment, stays anchored to the membrane. The released extracellular domain represents a binding protein for many potential ligands, including neurotrophins, pro-neurotrophin precursors, beta-amyloid. Shedding of the p75NTR extracellular region can be both constituve and stimulated. The constitutive shedding is dependent on signalling via the p38 MAP kinase. Shedding can be stimulated by the phorbol ester PMA, acting through protein kinase C and ERK activation, and by a tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor. Activation of TRKA by NGF (or TRKB by BDNF) also induces release of the p75NTR extracellular domain. The alpha-secretase cleavage is required for the subsequent cleavage by gamma-secretase.

2010	8	translocation	IL-6 activates the tyrosine phosphorylation of STATs (Akira et al. 1994, Zhong et al. 1994) by JAKs (Hemmann et al. 1996) at a site that is essential for dimerization. For STAT1 this is tyrosine-701, for STAT3 tyrosine-705 (Kaptein et al. 1996, Shuai et al. 1994). Tyrosine phosphorylation leads to homo- or heterodimerization and translocation to the nucleus (Zhong et al. 1994), where the dimers bind to enhancers of interleukin-6- inducible genes e.g. acute phase protein genes, resulting in transcriptional activation.

2013	8	adds_modification	PRICKLE1 is a conserved PCP protein with a localization pattern opposite to that of DVL. PRICKLE1 is recruited to the PARD6A:ppDVL2:SMURF complex through its interaction with DVL and is subsequently ubiquitinated by the E3 ligase activity of SMURF (Narimatsu et al, 2009; Jenny et al, 2005). This leads to localized degradation of PRICKLE1, contributing to its asymmetrical localization (Narimatsu et al, 2009). Note that in this reaction the interaction between PRICKLE1 and DVL is not shown.	SMURF;PRIC1

Studies of some viral systems suggest that this discontinuous structure is required for passage of the viral duplex DNA into the nucleus while there are evidence contrary to this observation. Studies in vitro indicate that human nuclear flap endonuclease and DNA ligase can remove the flap and seal the plus-strand discontinuity in HIV-1 DNA (Miller et al. 1995; Rausch and Le Grice 2004; Rumbaugh et al. 1998), although role of flap is not yet clear.

2010	8	adds_modification	In humans, the phosphorylated MNK1 kinase phosphorylates the adaptor protein Sprouty2 on Ser112 and Ser121, and also at some other serine and threonine residues. MNK1 appears not to form a complex with Sprouty2. Some of these (including the two main sites mentioned above) conform to the serine-containing consensus sites for phosphorylation by MNK1 kinase (K/R-X-X-S, R-X-S). It appears that serine phosphorylation is required to protect Sprouty2 from degradation.<br><br>In the absence of serine phosphorylation, phosphorylation of Tyr55 and subsequent binding to E3 ubiquitin ligase, CBL, is enhanced. Serine phosphorylation of Sprouty2 appears to stabilise the protein by interfering with its potential phosphorylation of Tyr55 (Sprouty2 appears to be a poor substrate for c-Src kinase) in response to growth factor stimulation.	p- MNK1;SPY2
