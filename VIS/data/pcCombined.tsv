Though it is now known that other proteins such as C1q and elastin also contain 4-Hyp, collagen is by far the major source (Adams & Frank 1980). 4-Hyp is required for collagen stability at physiological temperatures. The abundance of Hyp in animal proteins is ~4%, making it more abundant than the amino-acids Cys, Gln, His, Met, Phe, Trp and Tyr (McCaldon & Argos 1988). In collagen Hyp abundance is much higher at ~38% (Ramshaw et al. 1998). Full collagen proline hydroxylation significantly raises the melting temperature (Tm) by stabilizing the collagen triple helix (Berg & Prockop 1973a), a process that has been studied extensively using synthetic collagen peptides (Sakakibara et al. 1973, Holmgren et al. 1998) and is well understood at the structural level (Shoulders & Raines 2009). Collagen 4-Hyp content is relatively stable, with small differences between collagen types. Collagen type I has approximately 1 4-Hyp for every 10 residues, roughly 50% of available prolines (Kivirikko et al. 1992). Conversion of Pro to (2S,4R)-4-hydroxyproline (4-Hyp) is the most prevalent posttranslational modification in humans, catalyzed by prolyl 4-hydroxylase (P4H). Mammalian prolyl 4-hydroxylase is an alpha2 beta2 tetramer (Berg & Prockop 1973b). The 59-kDa alpha subunit contains the substrate-binding domain and the enzymic active site (Helaakoski et al. 1989). Humans and most other vertebrates have three isoforms of the alpha subunit, isoform alpha-1 is the most prevalent. The pair of alpha subunits can be any of the three isoforms (Gorres & Raines 2010). The 55-kDa beta subunit is protein disulphide isomerase (PDI), which has additional functions in collagen formation. As part of P4H it retains the tetramer in the ER lumen and maintains the otherwise insoluble alpha subunit in an active form (Vuori et al. 1992, Nietfeld & Kemp 1981). P4H is a member of the non-heme iron(II), alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase family. Molecular oxygen (O2), 2-oxoglutarate (alpha-ketoglutarate) and iron(II) are required for its activity (Hutton & Udenfriend 1966). During the reaction, alpha-ketoglutarate is oxidatively decarboxylated producing succinate and CO2 (Rhoads & Udenfriend 1968, Gorres & Raines 2010). Ascorbate is required as a cofactor but not consumed (Kivirikko et al 1989). The minimum substrate required for hydroxylation is an Xaa-Pro-Gly tripeptide, with Pro preferred in the Xaa position, though hydroxylation can occur at lower rates with a variety of residues at this position (Kivirikko et al. 1972).

Full collagen proline hydroxylation significantly raises the melting temperature (Tm) by stabilizing the collagen triple helix (Berg & Prockop 1973a), a process that has been studied extensively using synthetic collagen peptides (Sakakibara et al. 1973, Holmgren et al. 1998) and is well understood at the structural level (Shoulders & Raines 2009). Collagen 4-Hyp content is relatively stable, with small differences between collagen types. Collagen type I has approximately 1 4-Hyp for every 10 residues, roughly 50% of available prolines (Kivirikko et al. 1992). Conversion of Pro to (2S,4R)-4-hydroxyproline (4-Hyp) is the most prevalent posttranslational modification in humans, catalyzed by prolyl 4-hydroxylase (P4H). Mammalian prolyl 4-hydroxylase is an alpha2 beta2 tetramer (Berg & Prockop 1973b). The 59-kDa alpha subunit contains the substrate-binding domain and the enzymic active site (Helaakoski et al. 1989). Humans and most other vertebrates have three isoforms of the alpha subunit, isoform alpha-1 is the most prevalent. The pair of alpha subunits can be any of the three isoforms (Gorres & Raines 2010). The 55-kDa beta subunit is protein disulphide isomerase (PDI), which has additional functions in collagen formation. As part of P4H it retains the tetramer in the ER lumen and maintains the otherwise insoluble alpha subunit in an active form (Vuori et al. 1992, Nietfeld & Kemp 1981). P4H is a member of the non-heme iron(II), alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase family. Molecular oxygen (O2), 2-oxoglutarate (alpha-ketoglutarate) and iron(II) are required for its activity (Hutton & Udenfriend 1966). During the reaction, alpha-ketoglutarate is oxidatively decarboxylated producing succinate and CO2 (Rhoads & Udenfriend 1968, Gorres & Raines 2010). Ascorbate is required as a cofactor but not consumed (Kivirikko et al 1989). The minimum substrate required for hydroxylation is an Xaa-Pro-Gly tripeptide, with Pro preferred in the Xaa position, though hydroxylation can occur at lower rates with a variety of residues at this position (Kivirikko et al. 1972). A number of other peptides, notably elastin, are substrates for P4H (Bhatnagar 1978).<br><br>For brevity, all forms of collagen propeptide are shown as having 3X 4-Hyp residues following the action of P4H."

As part of P4H it retains the tetramer in the ER lumen and maintains the otherwise insoluble alpha subunit in an active form (Vuori et al. 1992, Nietfeld & Kemp 1981). P4H is a member of the non-heme iron(II), alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase family. Molecular oxygen (O2), 2-oxoglutarate (alpha-ketoglutarate) and iron(II) are required for its activity (Hutton & Udenfriend 1966). During the reaction, alpha-ketoglutarate is oxidatively decarboxylated producing succinate and CO2 (Rhoads & Udenfriend 1968, Gorres & Raines 2010). Ascorbate is required as a cofactor but not consumed (Kivirikko et al 1989). The minimum substrate required for hydroxylation is an Xaa-Pro-Gly tripeptide, with Pro preferred in the Xaa position, though hydroxylation can occur at lower rates with a variety of residues at this position (Kivirikko et al. 1972). A number of other peptides, notably elastin, are substrates for P4H (Bhatnagar 1978).<br><br>For brevity, all forms of collagen propeptide are shown as having 3X 4-Hyp residues following the action of P4H."

Though it is now known that other proteins such as C1q and elastin also contain 4-Hyp, collagen is by far the major source (Adams & Frank 1980). 4-Hyp is required for collagen stability at physiological temperatures. The abundance of Hyp in animal proteins is ~4%, making it more abundant than the amino-acids Cys, Gln, His, Met, Phe, Trp and Tyr (McCaldon & Argos 1988). In collagen Hyp abundance is much higher at ~38% (Ramshaw et al. 1998). Full collagen proline hydroxylation significantly raises the melting temperature (Tm) by stabilizing the collagen triple helix (Berg & Prockop 1973a), a process that has been studied extensively using synthetic collagen peptides (Sakakibara et al. 1973, Holmgren et al. 1998) and is well understood at the structural level (Shoulders & Raines 2009). Collagen 4-Hyp content is relatively stable, with small differences between collagen types. Collagen type I has approximately 1 4-Hyp for every 10 residues, roughly 50% of available prolines (Kivirikko et al. 1992). Conversion of Pro to (2S,4R)-4-hydroxyproline (4-Hyp) is the most prevalent posttranslational modification in humans, catalyzed by prolyl 4-hydroxylase (P4H). Mammalian prolyl 4-hydroxylase is an alpha2 beta2 tetramer (Berg & Prockop 1973b). The 59-kDa alpha subunit contains the substrate-binding domain and the enzymic active site (Helaakoski et al. 1989).

Though it is now known that other proteins such as C1q and elastin also contain 4-Hyp, collagen is by far the major source (Adams & Frank 1980). 4-Hyp is required for collagen stability at physiological temperatures. The abundance of Hyp in animal proteins is ~4%, making it more abundant than the amino-acids Cys, Gln, His, Met, Phe, Trp and Tyr (McCaldon & Argos 1988). In collagen Hyp abundance is much higher at ~38% (Ramshaw et al. 1998). Full collagen proline hydroxylation significantly raises the melting temperature (Tm) by stabilizing the collagen triple helix (Berg & Prockop 1973a), a process that has been studied extensively using synthetic collagen peptides (Sakakibara et al. 1973, Holmgren et al. 1998) and is well understood at the structural level (Shoulders & Raines 2009). Collagen 4-Hyp content is relatively stable, with small differences between collagen types. Collagen type I has approximately 1 4-Hyp for every 10 residues, roughly 50% of available prolines (Kivirikko et al. 1992). Conversion of Pro to (2S,4R)-4-hydroxyproline (4-Hyp) is the most prevalent posttranslational modification in humans, catalyzed by prolyl 4-hydroxylase (P4H). Mammalian prolyl 4-hydroxylase is an alpha2 beta2 tetramer (Berg & Prockop 1973b). The 59-kDa alpha subunit contains the substrate-binding domain and the enzymic active site (Helaakoski et al. 1989). Humans and most other vertebrates have three isoforms of the alpha subunit, isoform alpha-1 is the most prevalent. The pair of alpha subunits can be any of the three isoforms (Gorres & Raines 2010). The 55-kDa beta subunit is protein disulphide isomerase (PDI), which has additional functions in collagen formation. As part of P4H it retains the tetramer in the ER lumen and maintains the otherwise insoluble alpha subunit in an active form (Vuori et al. 1992, Nietfeld & Kemp 1981). P4H is a member of the non-heme iron(II), alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase family. Molecular oxygen (O2), 2-oxoglutarate (alpha-ketoglutarate) and iron(II) are required for its activity (Hutton & Udenfriend 1966). During the reaction, alpha-ketoglutarate is oxidatively decarboxylated producing succinate and CO2 (Rhoads & Udenfriend 1968, Gorres & Raines 2010). Ascorbate is required as a cofactor but not consumed (Kivirikko et al 1989).

Collagen type I has approximately 1 4-Hyp for every 10 residues, roughly 50% of available prolines (Kivirikko et al. 1992). Conversion of Pro to (2S,4R)-4-hydroxyproline (4-Hyp) is the most prevalent posttranslational modification in humans, catalyzed by prolyl 4-hydroxylase (P4H). Mammalian prolyl 4-hydroxylase is an alpha2 beta2 tetramer (Berg & Prockop 1973b). The 59-kDa alpha subunit contains the substrate-binding domain and the enzymic active site (Helaakoski et al. 1989). Humans and most other vertebrates have three isoforms of the alpha subunit, isoform alpha-1 is the most prevalent. The pair of alpha subunits can be any of the three isoforms (Gorres & Raines 2010). The 55-kDa beta subunit is protein disulphide isomerase (PDI), which has additional functions in collagen formation. As part of P4H it retains the tetramer in the ER lumen and maintains the otherwise insoluble alpha subunit in an active form (Vuori et al. 1992, Nietfeld & Kemp 1981). P4H is a member of the non-heme iron(II), alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase family. Molecular oxygen (O2), 2-oxoglutarate (alpha-ketoglutarate) and iron(II) are required for its activity (Hutton & Udenfriend 1966). During the reaction, alpha-ketoglutarate is oxidatively decarboxylated producing succinate and CO2 (Rhoads & Udenfriend 1968, Gorres & Raines 2010). Ascorbate is required as a cofactor but not consumed (Kivirikko et al 1989). The minimum substrate required for hydroxylation is an Xaa-Pro-Gly tripeptide, with Pro preferred in the Xaa position, though hydroxylation can occur at lower rates with a variety of residues at this position (Kivirikko et al. 1972). A number of other peptides, notably elastin, are substrates for P4H (Bhatnagar 1978).<br><br>For brevity, all forms of collagen propeptide are shown as having 3X 4-Hyp residues following the action of P4H."

The abundance of Hyp in animal proteins is ~4%, making it more abundant than the amino-acids Cys, Gln, His, Met, Phe, Trp and Tyr (McCaldon & Argos 1988).

Though it is now known that other proteins such as C1q and elastin also contain 4-Hyp, collagen is by far the major source (Adams & Frank 1980). 4-Hyp is required for collagen stability at physiological temperatures. The abundance of Hyp in animal proteins is ~4%, making it more abundant than the amino-acids Cys, Gln, His, Met, Phe, Trp and Tyr (McCaldon & Argos 1988). In collagen Hyp abundance is much higher at ~38% (Ramshaw et al. 1998). Full collagen proline hydroxylation significantly raises the melting temperature (Tm) by stabilizing the collagen triple helix (Berg & Prockop 1973a), a process that has been studied extensively using synthetic collagen peptides (Sakakibara et al. 1973, Holmgren et al. 1998) and is well understood at the structural level (Shoulders & Raines 2009). Collagen 4-Hyp content is relatively stable, with small differences between collagen types. Collagen type I has approximately 1 4-Hyp for every 10 residues, roughly 50% of available prolines (Kivirikko et al. 1992). Conversion of Pro to (2S,4R)-4-hydroxyproline (4-Hyp) is the most prevalent posttranslational modification in humans, catalyzed by prolyl 4-hydroxylase (P4H).

The transmembrane heptahelical domain of SMO has been shown to bind to a number of natural and synthetic molecules, many of which are structurally related to sterols, and this binding can activate or repress SMO activity (Mas et al, 2010; Dwyer et al, 2007; Nachtergaele et al, 2012; Corcoran et al, 2006). Together, these data suggest a speculative model where PTCH regulates SMO activity by controlling the flux of sterol-related SMO agonists and/or antagonists, although this has not been fully substantiated (Khaliullina et al, 2009; reviewed in Rohatgi and Scott, 2007; Briscoe and Therond, 2013).<br>In the absence of Hh signal, SMO is largely found in intracellular vesicles, with a fraction localized to the plasma membrane (Milenkovic et al, 2009; Huangfu et al, 2006; Corbit et al, 2005; Rohatgi et al, 2007; Wang et al, 2009; Wilson et al, 2009). Like GLI2, 3 and SUFU, however, SMO may traffic through the cilium in the absence of ligand (Wilson et al, 2009; Kim et al, 2009). SMO and PTCH appear to have opposing localizations in both the 'off' and 'on' state, with PTCH exiting and SMO entering the cilium upon Hh pathway activation (Denef et al, 2000; Rohatgi et al, 2007; reviewed in Goetz and Anderson, 2010; Hui and Angers, 2011). Clearance of PTCH from the ciliary membrane in the presence of Hh is promoted by its ubiquitination by the E3 ligase SMURF (Huang et al, 2013; Yue et al, 2014)<br>Like the Drosophila homologue, vertebrate SMO appears to exists as a constitutive dimer. Dimerization is mediated by the N-terminal Cys-rich domain (CRD) and is required for function (Zhao et al, 2007). The C-terminal tail of SMO has arginine-rich clusters that appear to regulate the conformation of the tails in the dimer, maintaining the SMO dimer in an inactive state. In Drosophila, the inhibitory effect of the arginine-rich region is counteracted upon Hh pathway activation by PKA-mediated phosphorylation of adjacent serine residues. This promotes an open tail conformation that is required for cell surface accumulation and signaling (Zhao et al, 2007; Chen et al, 2010). These consensus PKA motifs are not conserved in the vertebrate SMO C-terminal tail, and a role for PKA-mediated phosphorylation and direct activation of SMO appears not to hold true in mammalian cells (Zhao et al, 2007; Tuson et al, 2011). A similar activating phosphorylation of vertebrate SMO may be CK1 or GRK2-dependent (Chen et al, 2011)."

Fringe enzymes modulate NOTCH activity (Cohen et al. 1997, Johnston et al. 1997) by decreasing the affinity of NOTCH extracellular domain for JAG ligands (Br_ckner et al. 2000). In developing mouse thymocytes, Lfng enhances Notch1 activation by Dll4, resulting in prolonged Notch1 signaling that promotes self-renewal of TCR-beta-expressing progenitors (Yuan et al. 2011).

The C peptides were removed later, probably at the cell membrane-ECM interface (Canty-Laird et al. 2012). <br><br>Processing of procollagens I, II, and III results in an almost complete removal of both the N- and C-propeptides. Procollagen type I-III N-propeptides are removed by disintegrin and metalloprotease with thrombospondin motifs (ADAMTS) family members -2, -3 and 14*. These are themselves synthesized as proenzymes and activated by the removal of an inhibitory prodomain, probably by furin-like convertases (Wang et al. 2003). Type V collagen N-propeptide removal is partial, and reported to be mediated by BMP-1 which cleaves between the proline/arginine-rich protein domain and the variable domain of the alpha1 chain and between the small and the large collagenous domain of alpha3 chain (refs. in Colige et al. 2005). The retention of some N-propeptides occurs in a tissue specific manner and may be a mechanism to inhibit lateral fibril growth (Silver et al. 2003).<br><br><br>*ADAMTS2 is active against collagen types I (Lapire et al. 1971), II (Colige et al. 1995) and III (Wang et al. 2003 types I-III). ADAMTS3 has activity against type I (Le Goff 2006) and II collagen (Fernandes et al. 2001). ADAMTS14 has activity against type I collagen (Colige et al. 2002)."

This occurs in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (Engel & Prockop 1991). Compared with the folding of globular proteins and coiled-coil structures, the concentration-independent folding steps of collagen are extremely slow (B_chinger et al. 1980). Triple helix formation combines a fast process, interpreted as the folding of regions devoid of cis residues, and a slow process, limited by the slow kinetics of cis to trans prolyl-isomerization (B_chinger et al. 1978). Triple-helix formation in regions devoid of cis-prolyl bonds is 3-4 times faster than formation limited by prolyl isomerization reactions (Bachmann et al. 2005). Conversion to trans is required as only trans-peptide bonds can be incorporated into the collagen triple helix (Zeng et al. 1998). Efficient helix folding requires the presence of the 3-prolyl hydroxylation complex. This trimer of Prolyl 3-hydroxylase 1 (LEPRE1), Cyclophilin B (CyPB), also called Peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase B (PPIB) and CRTAP has 3-prolyl hydroxylase, PPIase and procollagen chaperone properties (Ishikawa et al. 2009, van Dijk et al. 2009). Efficient folding involves additional collagen-specific chaperones such as Serpin H1 (HSP47 - Smith et al. 1995). CyPB belongs to the cyclophilins, a conserved class of intracellular and/or secreted proteins originally identified as cellular binding proteins for the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A. They are peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerases (PPIases), which catalyze the cis-trans isomerisation of peptide bonds. CyPB localises to the rough ER but is also secreted extracellularly. It directly interacts with procollagen and is believed to be responsible for converting procollagen cis- to trans-conformers (Zeng et al. 1998). CyPB and Serpin H1 are also involved in procollagen export and secretion. Results obtained with collagen peptides suggest that variations in the Gly-X-Y sequence are likely to result in a non-uniform helical twist along the length of a collagen fibril.

CyPB belongs to the cyclophilins, a conserved class of intracellular and/or secreted proteins originally identified as cellular binding proteins for the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A. They are peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerases (PPIases), which catalyze the cis-trans isomerisation of peptide bonds. CyPB localises to the rough ER but is also secreted extracellularly. It directly interacts with procollagen and is believed to be responsible for converting procollagen cis- to trans-conformers (Zeng et al. 1998). CyPB and Serpin H1 are also involved in procollagen export and secretion.

Triple helix formation combines a fast process, interpreted as the folding of regions devoid of cis residues, and a slow process, limited by the slow kinetics of cis to trans prolyl-isomerization (B_chinger et al. 1978). Triple-helix formation in regions devoid of cis-prolyl bonds is 3-4 times faster than formation limited by prolyl isomerization reactions (Bachmann et al. 2005). Conversion to trans is required as only trans-peptide bonds can be incorporated into the collagen triple helix (Zeng et al. 1998). Efficient helix folding requires the presence of the 3-prolyl hydroxylation complex. This trimer of Prolyl 3-hydroxylase 1 (LEPRE1), Cyclophilin B (CyPB), also called Peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase B (PPIB) and CRTAP has 3-prolyl hydroxylase, PPIase and procollagen chaperone properties (Ishikawa et al. 2009, van Dijk et al. 2009). Efficient folding involves additional collagen-specific chaperones such as Serpin H1 (HSP47 - Smith et al. 1995). CyPB belongs to the cyclophilins, a conserved class of intracellular and/or secreted proteins originally identified as cellular binding proteins for the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A. They are peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerases (PPIases), which catalyze the cis-trans isomerisation of peptide bonds. CyPB localises to the rough ER but is also secreted extracellularly. It directly interacts with procollagen and is believed to be responsible for converting procollagen cis- to trans-conformers (Zeng et al. 1998). CyPB and Serpin H1 are also involved in procollagen export and secretion. Results obtained with collagen peptides suggest that variations in the Gly-X-Y sequence are likely to result in a non-uniform helical twist along the length of a collagen fibril.

CyPB belongs to the cyclophilins, a conserved class of intracellular and/or secreted proteins originally identified as cellular binding proteins for the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A. They are peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerases (PPIases), which catalyze the cis-trans isomerisation of peptide bonds. CyPB localises to the rough ER but is also secreted extracellularly. It directly interacts with procollagen and is believed to be responsible for converting procollagen cis- to trans-conformers (Zeng et al. 1998). CyPB and Serpin H1 are also involved in procollagen export and secretion.

Triple helix formation combines a fast process, interpreted as the folding of regions devoid of cis residues, and a slow process, limited by the slow kinetics of cis to trans prolyl-isomerization (B_chinger et al. 1978). Triple-helix formation in regions devoid of cis-prolyl bonds is 3-4 times faster than formation limited by prolyl isomerization reactions (Bachmann et al. 2005). Conversion to trans is required as only trans-peptide bonds can be incorporated into the collagen triple helix (Zeng et al. 1998). Efficient helix folding requires the presence of the 3-prolyl hydroxylation complex. This trimer of Prolyl 3-hydroxylase 1 (LEPRE1), Cyclophilin B (CyPB), also called Peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase B (PPIB) and CRTAP has 3-prolyl hydroxylase, PPIase and procollagen chaperone properties (Ishikawa et al. 2009, van Dijk et al. 2009). Efficient folding involves additional collagen-specific chaperones such as Serpin H1 (HSP47 - Smith et al. 1995). CyPB belongs to the cyclophilins, a conserved class of intracellular and/or secreted proteins originally identified as cellular binding proteins for the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A. They are peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerases (PPIases), which catalyze the cis-trans isomerisation of peptide bonds. CyPB localises to the rough ER but is also secreted extracellularly. It directly interacts with procollagen and is believed to be responsible for converting procollagen cis- to trans-conformers (Zeng et al. 1998). CyPB and Serpin H1 are also involved in procollagen export and secretion. Results obtained with collagen peptides suggest that variations in the Gly-X-Y sequence are likely to result in a non-uniform helical twist along the length of a collagen fibril.

The cytoplasmic tail of E-cadherin binds to the armadillo repeat protein beta-catenin, a target of the Wnt signaling pathway and a cofactor for TCF/LEF-mediated transcription (Gavard & Mge 2005). Beta-catenin in turn binds alpha-catenin, which interacts with the actin microfilament network, actin and the actin-binding proteins vinculin, formins, alpha-actinin, zonula occludin protein, and afadin (Bershadsky 2004). Cellcell adhesions also contain desmosomes, which link cell contacts to intermediate filaments, and nectin-based, calcium-independent adhesions, which are linked to actin (Takai & Nakanishi 2003, Yin and Green 2004). The critical importance of E-cadherin to normal development and tissue function is demonstrated by embryonic lethal E-cadherin gene mouse knockouts (Larue et al. 1994). Loss of cadherin-based cell-cell adhesion is a hallmark of carcinogenesis, correlating with tumour progression, allowing cells to escape normal growth control signals, resulting in loss of differentiation and increased cell proliferation associated with invasive behaviour (Frixen et al. 1991, Capaldo & Macara 2007). Full-length 120-kDa CDH1 protein is cleaved in the ectodomain close to the plasma membrane by a number of metalloproteases, generating an extracellular 38-kDa C-terminal fragment (CTF) termed CTF1 which can be further processed by a gamma-secretase-like activity to a soluble 33-kDa CTF2 (Marambaud et al. 2002, Roy & Berx 2008). MMP3, MMP7 (No et al. 2001, canine MMPs), MMP9 (Symowicz et al. 2007), plasmin (Ryniers et al. 2002, canine plasmin), Kallikrien 7 (Johnson et al. 2007), ADAM10 (Maretzky et al. 2005) and ADAM15 (Najy et al. 2008) all cleave CDH1 extracellularly, close to the transmembrane region. Presenilin-1 (Marambaud et al. 2002), the catalytic subunit of gamma-secretase (Herreman et al. 2003, Li et al. 2003), cleaves CDH1 producing a soluble 33-kDa fragment termed CTF2. Other enzymes like caspase-3 (Steinhusen et al. 2001) and calpain-1 (Rios-Doria et al. 2003) cleave E-cadherin in its cytoplasmic part releasing an intracellular 37 kDa C-terminal fragment."

The 3-Hyp content of collagen is much more variable than that of 4-Hyp, varying between collagen types, tissues, developmental stages and pathological states (Kivirikko et al. 1992). It is more prevalent in type IV and V collagens at 10-15 3-Hyp residues (Bentz et al. 1983) than in Type I-III fibrillar collagens which have a single 3-Hyp residue per chain; the alpha-1 chain of type I collagen has 3-Hyp at residue 986 (Fietzek et al. 1972, Marini et al. 2007). 3-Hyp is formed from Pro in the Xaa position of Xaa-Hyp-Gly triplets (Gryder et al. 1975, Kivirikko et al. 1992).

Like P4H, P3H requires molecular oxygen, alpha-ketoglutarate, iron(II), and ascorbate for activity. P3H1 is homologous to mammalian leprecan or growth suppressor 1 (Gros1), and forms a 3-prolyl hydroxylation complex with cartilage-associated protein (CRTAP) and a peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase, cyclophilin B (CypB), which is encoded by the PPIB gene (Vranka et al. 2004). Lack of 3-Hyp in Type I and II collagens leads to an osteogenesis imperfecta (OI)-like disease, as demonstrated by CRTAP and PPIB knock-out mice (Morello et al. 2006, Choi et al. 2009) and by mutations in human LEPRE1 (which encodes P3H1), CRTAP, and PPIB (Barnes et al. 2006, Cabral et al. 2007, van Dijk et al. 2009).

P3H1 is homologous to mammalian leprecan or growth suppressor 1 (Gros1), and forms a 3-prolyl hydroxylation complex with cartilage-associated protein (CRTAP) and a peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase, cyclophilin B (CypB), which is encoded by the PPIB gene (Vranka et al. 2004).

Formation of nSBs is initiated by the interaction between HSF1 and pericentric tandem repeats of satellite III sequences on chromosome 9, where sat III repeats are transcribed by RNA polymerase II in an HSF1-dependent manner. (Jolly C et al. 2002, 2004). HSF1 can also bind to DNA regions enriched in sat II and sat III repeated sequences detected on other human chromosomes (Eymery A et al. 2010).

S106 phosphorylation is insulin-induced, and could be mediated by CDK1, as it is proline-directed (Wu et al. 2011). CDC28, a yeast homolog of CDK1, was shown to phosphorylate PAH1, while NEM1:SPO7 removes CDC28-introduced phosphate groups. Lipin phosphorylation regulates lipin localization, with phosphorylated lipins being soluble and dephosphorylated lipins being membrane-bound (Grimsey et al. 2008, Choi et al. 2011). The association of lipins with the nuclear envelope brings lipins in proximity to its substrate, PA, thereby enabling lipin catalytic activity (Karanasios et al. 2010). Catalytic activity of PAH1 regulates the morphology and dynamics of endoplasmic reticulum and nuclear membranes in yeast. In C. elegans and in human cell lines, lipin catalytic activity is needed for mitotic progression as it facilitates depolymerization of the nuclear lamina and nuclear envelope breakdown (Santos-Rosa et al. 2005, Kim et al. 2007, Gorjanacz et al. 2009, Golden et al. 2009, Choi et al. 2011, Mall et al. 2012)."

Cbl may be phosphorylated prior to this IL-3 stimulated tyrosyl phosphorylation (Park et al. 1998). The kinase responsible for Cbl phosphorylation may be dependent on cell type; Fyn is demonstrated to have the ability to phosphorylate Cbl (Hunter et al. 1999), other candidates include Hck, Lyn (Hunter et al. 1999) and Syk (Park et al. 1998).<br><br> Tyrosines 700, 731 and 774 are the major sites of Cbl phosphorylation by non-receptor protein tyrosine kinases, with none showing any particular specificity for sites (Tsygankov et al. 2001). Fyn was observed to be constitutively associated with Cbl in lysates of several different cell types including the interleukin-3-dependent murine myeloid cell line 32Dcl3, and the prolactin-dependent rat thymoma cell line Nb2. Cbl phosphorylation at Y731 is postulated to provide an additional interaction between Cbl and the SH2 domain of p85-PI3K (Hunter et al. 1999). Cbl-p85 association increases in activated cells (Panchamoorthy et al. 1996). Expression of a Cbl Y731F mutant which abolishes binding of Cbl to p85 markedly increased levels of p85-PI3K (Dufour et al. 2008). Cbl-p85 binding negatively regulates PI3K activity (Fang et al. 2001); Cbl phosphorylation increased PI3K ubiquitination and proteasome degradation (Dufour et al. 2008). Cbl association with members of the Crk family is mediated by phosphorylation of Y700 and Y774 (Andoniou et al. 1996), binding with Vav is mediated by Y770 (Marengere et al 1997)."

Unlike other FN1-binding integrins it is a specialist at this task. In solution FN1 occurs as a dimer. Binding to alpha5beta1 integrin stimulates FN1 self-association; blocking the RGD-cell binding domain of FN1 blocks fibril formation (Fogerty et al. 1990). FN1 binding is believed to induce integrin clustering, which promotes FN1-FN1 interactions. Integrin clustering is mediated by association between integrins and intracellular actin stress fibers (Calderwood et al. 2000). Binding of integrins to each of the monomers in the FN1 dimer pair is thought to trigger a conformational change in FN1 that exposes 'cryptic' FN1 binding sites that allow additional fibronectin dimers to bind without the requirement for pre-association with integrins (Singh et al. 2010). This non-covalent interaction may involve interactions with fibrillin (Ohashi & Erickson 2009). I1-5 functions as a unit that is the primary FN matrix assembly domain (Sottile et al. 1991) but other units are likely to be involved (Singh et al. 2010). Other integrins able to bind FN1 include alphaIIbBeta3, which is highly expressed on platelets where it predominantly binds fibrinogen leading to thrombus formation but also binds FN1 (Savage et al. 1996). Alpha4beta1 mediates cell-cell contacts and cell-matrix contacts through the ligands VCAM-1 and FN1, respectively (Humphries et al. 1995). Integrins alpha3beta1, alpha4beta7, alphaVbeta1, 3 (Johansson et al. 1997), 6 (Busk et al. 1992) and alpha8beta1 (Muller et al. 1995, Farias et al. 2005) are all able to bind FN1. <br><br>Tenacious binding of free fibronectin to cells leads to enhanced fibronectin matrix assembly and the formation of a polymerized fibronectin ""cocoon"" around the cells.

Ser230 is located in this regulatory domain of HSF1 and is constitutively and stress-inducibly phosphorylated (Holmberg CI et al. 2001). Analyses with phosphopeptide-specific antibody and site-directed mutagenesis revealed that phosphorylation at Ser230 enhanced the inducible HSF1 transcriptional activity in heat-shocked human K562 erythroleukemia and HeLa cells (Holmberg CI et al 2001). Active calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) was shown to phosphorylate HSF1 at Ser230 in vitro. Moreover, CaMKII enhanced heat-induced tranactivating capacity of HSF1 and the level of endogenous Ser230 phosphorylation in K562 cells transfected with active CaMKII together with a CAT reporter plasmid containing the proximal HSE of human hsp70 promoter. Thus, CaMKII signaling may be involved in the positive regulation of HSF1-mediated transactivation. However, the possibility that other protein kinases might also phosphorylate Ser230 in vivo should not be excluded (Holmberg CI et al 2001)."

Photoactivated rhodopsin (MII or R*) catalyzes the exchange of GTP for GDP bound to Gt. Upon GTP/GDP exchange, Gt is released from MII and the Gt alpha with GTP bound (GNAT1 GTP) dissociates from Gt beta gamma subunits (GNB1:GNGT1). This mechanism was deciphered from bovine experiments (Pugh & Lamb 1993).

Gt is a heterotrimer of alpha1 (GNAT1) (van Dop et al. 1989, Fong 1992), beta1 (GNB1) (Codina et al. 1986) and gamma1 (GNGT1) (Tao et al. 1993) subunits. Photoactivated rhodopsin (MII or R*) catalyzes the exchange of GTP for GDP bound to Gt. Upon GTP/GDP exchange, Gt is released from MII and the Gt alpha with GTP bound (GNAT1 GTP) dissociates from Gt beta gamma subunits (GNB1:GNGT1). This mechanism was deciphered from bovine experiments (Pugh & Lamb 1993).

The extracellular domain has five cadherin-type repeat ectodomain (EC) modules; the most membrane-distal EC mediates binding with CDH1 on adjacent cells (Boggon et al. 2002). Calcium ions bind between the EC domains of two CDH1 peptides to form a dimer with a rod-like conformation (Boggon et al. 2002) which is required for cell-cell interaction (Gumbiner 1996, Patel et al. 2006). The cytoplasmic tail of E-cadherin binds to the armadillo repeat protein beta-catenin, a target of the Wnt signaling pathway and a cofactor for TCF/LEF-mediated transcription (Gavard & Mge 2005). Beta-catenin in turn binds alpha-catenin, which interacts with the actin microfilament network, actin and the actin-binding proteins vinculin, formins, alpha-actinin, zonula occludin protein, and afadin (Bershadsky 2004). Cellcell adhesions also contain desmosomes, which link cell contacts to intermediate filaments, and nectin-based, calcium-independent adhesions, which are linked to actin (Takai & Nakanishi 2003, Yin and Green 2004). The critical importance of E-cadherin to normal development and tissue function is demonstrated by embryonic lethal E-cadherin gene mouse knockouts (Larue et al. 1994). Loss of cadherin-based cell-cell adhesion is a hallmark of carcinogenesis, correlating with tumour progression, allowing cells to escape normal growth control signals, resulting in loss of differentiation and increased cell proliferation associated with invasive behaviour (Frixen et al. 1991, Capaldo & Macara 2007). Full-length 120-kDa CDH1 protein is cleaved in the ectodomain close to the plasma membrane by a number of metalloproteases, generating an extracellular 38-kDa C-terminal fragment (CTF) termed CTF1 which can be further processed by a gamma-secretase-like activity to a soluble 33-kDa CTF2 (Marambaud et al. 2002, Roy & Berx 2008). MMP3, MMP7 (No et al. 2001, canine MMPs), MMP9 (Symowicz et al. 2007), plasmin (Ryniers et al. 2002, canine plasmin), Kallikrien 7 (Johnson et al. 2007), ADAM10 (Maretzky et al. 2005) and ADAM15 (Najy et al. 2008) all cleave CDH1 extracellularly, close to the transmembrane region. Presenilin-1 (Marambaud et al. 2002), the catalytic subunit of gamma-secretase (Herreman et al. 2003, Li et al. 2003), cleaves CDH1 producing a soluble 33-kDa fragment termed CTF2.

IL1B production and processing is stimulated when pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) such as bacterial LPS are detected by cells of the innate immune system, and in response to pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF. Detection of PAMPs by Toll receptors leads to rapid IL1 transcription/translation and subsequent processing by caspase-1 in macrophages and monocytes. Processing is triggered by the activation of members of the NLR family and their associated inflammasome complexes. IL1B lacks a signal peptide to direct it to the Golgi for subsequent secretion, so the mode of secretion is uncertain. Once secreted, IL1B binds membrane-bound IL1 receptors, followed by recruitment of the IL1 receptor accessory protein to form a high affinity receptor complex. Ligand induced receptor activation induces the intracellular association of a number of cytosolic adapter proteins triggering intracellular signal transduction. This series of steps facilitates the induction of nuclear factor-kappa B (NFkB) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activity, leading to downstream transcription of additional inflammatory cytokines, including IL1B itself.

Tpx;tpx2010	8	adds_modification	"Similar models explain JAK activation by the cytokine-like hormone receptors (GHR and PRLR) and interleukin receptors. JAK2 activation is believed to occur as mutual transactivation whereby JAK2 bound to one receptor chain phosphorylates JAK2 bound to the other receptor chain in the dimeric receptor. Transactivation is widely accepted (Herrington & Carter-Su 2001) having been originally proposed in the 1990's (Quelle et al. 1994, Hou et al. 2002). JAK phosphorylation is thought to lock the kinase domain in an active state; prior to this JAK2 is held in an inactive state by interactions between its kinase and pseudokinase domains (Giordanetto & Kroemer 2002). Although there are structures of JAK kinase domains (e.g. Lucet et al. 2006), no complete JAK structures are available and the activation mechanism remains poorly understood (Brooks & Waters 2010). The trigger for JAK activation is believed to be a conformational change in the receptor when ligand is bound, leading to a rotation of the cytoplasmic regions which brings the catalytic domains of bound JAK2 molecules into close proximity and frees them from inhibition by the pseudokinase domains. Supporting observations for cytokine-like hormone receptors include: JAK2 becomes tyrosine phosphorylated as a consequence of GHR activation by GH (Argetsinger et al. 1993); JAK2 is activated following PRLR activation (Campbell et al. 1994, Rui et al. 1994); forced dimerization of GH receptor domains is sufficient to activate signaling (Behncken et al. 2000); phosphorylation of JAK2 at Y1007 is critical for kinase activation (Feng et al. 1997, Lucet et al. 2006); JAK autophosphorylation at several other sites appears to regulate activity (e.g. Feener et al. 2004, Argetsinger et al. 2004, 2010).

Acvr2b__Tdgf1__Nodal__ALK4;smad22006	8	adds_modification	"Chk1 is a checkpoint kinase activated during genotoxic stress. Like ATR, Chk1 is essential for viability in mammals. Targeted gene disruption in mice shows that loss of Chk1 causes peri-implantation embryonic lethality. Even though ATR-ATRIP not bound to ssDNA can phosphorylate Chk1, Chk1 activation is greatly enhanced when recruited to stalled replication forks by physical interaction with a modified form of claspin and the Rad9-Hus1-Rad1 sliding clamp. Activation of Chk1 occurs following phosphorylation of two sites (serine 317 and serine 345). Mutational analysis indicates that modification of both sites is essential for maximal kinase activity, while phosphorylation of only a single site causes only weak activation of Chk1. Following phosphorylation, Chk1 can diffuse away from the complex to further amplify the checkpoint signal. ATR appears to be the primary kinase activating Chk1 as conditions that activate ATR (ultraviolet irradiation or treatment with hydroxyurea) also activate Chk1. Stresses that activate ATM, e.g., ionizing irradiation, do not cause significant Chk1 activation. While the ATR and ATM pathways are distinct, there is interplay between the two. For example, double-strand DNA breaks can be processed in an ATM-dependent manner to generate structures that can cause ATR and hence Chk1 activation. The ATR and ATM pathways also have mechanistic similarities. Analogous to the Chk1 kinase existing downstream of ATR, the Chk2 checkpoint kinase is modified and activated by ATM. Although having distinct structures, Chk1 and Chk2 also have overlapping targets with some substrate sites phosphorylatable by both kinases (e.g., serine 20 of p53)."	ATRIP__ATR;CHK12006	8	adds_modification	"Claspin is a replication fork-associated protein important for Chk1 activation. Claspin loads onto the fork during replication origin firing and travels with the fork during DNA synthesis. Upon fork uncoupling and ATR-ATRIP binding to persistent ssDNA, the activated ATR kinase phosphorylates claspin at two primary sites. Modification increases the affinity of claspin for Chk1. Studies of human or Xenopus claspin indicate that phosphorylation of both sites is essential for significant claspin-Chk1 association. Following claspin modification by ATR, Chk1 can be transiently recruited to the stalled replication fork for subsequent phosphorylation and activation by ATR. Activation of Chk1 allows modification of additional downstream targets, thus amplifying the checkpoint signal. While much of the mechanistic information concerning claspin action has been obtained using Xenopus laevis egg extracts and Xenopus claspin, factors with similar activity have been found in various eukaryotic species including S. cerevisiae (MRC1), S. pombe (mrc1), and humans.<p>Activated ATR phosphorylates human claspin on two sites, threonine 916 and serine 945."

Deactivation begins during the rising phase of the single photon response after MII binds rhodopsin kinase (GRK1), a serine/threonine protein kinase (Khani et al. 1996). GRK1 is activated by MII whereupon it phosphorylates MII at multiple serine and threonine sites on its C terminus. There are six serine and threonine residues that can be phosphorylated. Increasing phosphorylation progressively reduces the rate at which MII can activate transducin but full quenching requires the binding of arrestin (S-antigen or SAG, Yamaki et al. 1988) which binds to and sterically caps MII (Burns & Pugh 2010, Korenbrot 2012).<br><br>A substantial fraction of rhodopsin kinase (GRK1) is bound to recoverin (RCVRN) in darkness, when internal Ca2+ levels are high.

When Ca2+ levels drop with light exposure, Ca2+ dissociates from RCVRN and GRK1 is released.

In the NGF:p75NTR complex, a single p75 molecule is asymmetrically bound to a NGF homodimer, along the homodimeric interface of NGF. This causes an allosteric conformational change, which disables the NGF symmetry-related second p75 binding site. Therefore, it is possible that NGF has to perturb or alter the preformed p75 dimer orientation in order to initiate intracellular signalling. NGF:p75NTR complexes are not so long living as the NGF:TRKA complexes. This is due, at least in part, to the fact that TRKA homodimers are internalized, and continue signalling in endosomes.<br>Contrary to what is commonly believed, NGF bind to p75NTR and TRKA, individually, with a similar equilibrium binding constant (Kd ~ 1-2 nM). As a matter of fact, the association constant for NGF binding to p75NTR (k+1 = 8x10 to power of 6 M-1 s-1) is faster than for TRKA (k+1 = 8x10 to power of 5 M-1 s-1). On the other hand, the off rate of the NGF:TRKA complex ( k-1 = 7.2x10 to power of -5 s-1) is much slower than the NGF:p75NTR complex (k-1 = 1x10 to power of -3 s-1) . p75NTR and TRK receptors functionally interact, but the precise means by which this occurs has remained unresolved. This could result from a direct physical interaction or be explained by convergent signalling of these two receptors. Co-expression of both p75NTR and TRKA at the cell surface appears to result in the formation of a high-affinity binding site that has an accelerated rate of NGF association and a 30- to 100-fold higher affinity for NGF (Kd ~ 1-3 x 10 to power of -11 M) than either receptor alone.<br>The high-affinity binding sites appear to constitute 10%15% of the total NGF binding sites. The nature of such high affinity binding sites is still unclear. They could be due to a multimeric complex of p75:TRKA proteins. Alternatively, NGF might first rapidly bind to p75NTR and then be presented to TRKA in a conformation that lowers its TRKA association rate. Some authors even question the existence of these high affinity sites. Structural data on NGF complexes with p75NTR and TRKA extracellular domains suggest that formation of a ternary complex TRKA:NGF:p75NTR in a 1:2:1 ration is theoretically possible, although unlikely. However, biochemical data so far failed to show that this complex forms."

The major function of the protein complex is to load the Rad9-Hus1-Rad1 (9-1-1) complex onto DNA at sites of damage and/or stalled replication forks. This reaction is conceptually similar to the loading of the PCNA sliding clamp onto DNA by RFC. The association of the Rad17-RFC complex with ssDNA or gapped or primed DNA is significantly stimulated by RPA, but not by the heterologous E. coli SSB. Loading of the human 9-1-1 complex onto such DNA templates is also strongly stimulated by cognate RPA, but not yeast RPA. Although Rad17 and Rad9 are substrates of the ATR kinase activity, loading of the Rad17 and 9-1-1 complexes onto DNA occurs independent of ATR.<p>The Rad17-RFC complex is a heteropentamer structurally similar to RFC. The complex contains the four smaller RFC subunits (Rfc2 [p37], Rfc3 [p36], Rfc4 [p40], and Rfc5 [p38]) and the 75 kDa Rad17 subunit in place of the Rfc1 [p140] subunit. The Rad17 complex contains a weak ATPase that is slightly stimulated by primed DNA. Along with binding the 9-1-1 complex and RPA, the Rad17-RFC complex interacts with human MCM7 protein. Each of these interactions is critical for Chk1 activation.<p>The Rad17 subunit is conserved evolutionarily with the protein showing 49% identity at the amino acid level with the S. pombe rad17 protein. Targeted deletion of the N-terminal region of mouse Rad17 leads to embryonic lethality, strongly suggesting that human Rad17 is also essential for long-term viability.<p>Rad17-RFC complex associates with DNA substrates containing ssDNA regions including gapped or primed DNA in an ATP-independent reaction.

The non-liganded NRs recruit specific corepressor complexes of the NCOR/SMRT type, to mediate transcriptional repression of the target genes to which they are bound. During signaling, ligand binding to a specific domain in the NR proteins induces a conformational change that results in the exchange of the associated corepressor complex, and its replacement by a specific coactivator complex of either the TRAP/DRIP/Mediator type, or the p160/SRC type. The Mediator coactivator complexes typically nucleate around the MED1 coactivator protein, which is directly bound to the NR transcription factor (reviewed in Freedman, 1999; Malik, 2005).<br><br> A general feature of the NR proteins is that they each contain a specific protein interaction domain (PID), or domains, that mediates the specific binding interactions with the MED1 proteins. In the ligand-bound state, NRs each take part in an NR-MED1 binding reaction to form an NR-MED1 complex. The bound MED1 then functions to nucleate the assembly of additional specific coactivator proteins, depending on the cell and DNA context, such as what specific target gene promoter or enhancer they are bound to, and in what cell type.<br><br> The formation of specific MED1-containing coactivator complexes on specific NR proteins has been well-characterized for a number of the human NR proteins. For example, binding of Vitamin D to the human Vitamin D3 Receptor was found to result in the recruitment of a specific complex of D Receptor Interacting Proteins - the DRIP coactivator complex (Rachez, 1998). Within the DRIP complex, the DRIP205 subunit was later renamed human ""MED1"", based on sequence similarities with yeast MED1 (reviewed in Bourbon, 2004).<br><br> Similarly, binding of thyroid hormone (TH) to the human TH Receptor (THRA or THRB) was found to result in the recruitment of a specific complex of Thyroid Receptor Associated Proteins - the TRAP coactivator complex (Yuan, 1998). The TRAP220 subunit was later identified to be the Mediator 1 (MED1) homologue (summarized in Bourbon, et al., 2004; Table 1).<br><br> The 48 human NR proteins each contain the PID(s) known to mediate interaction with the human MED1 protein. Direct NR-MED1 protein-protein interactions have been shown for a number of the NR proteins. The MED1-interacting PIDs are conserved in all of the human NRs. Therefore, each of the human NRs is known or expected to interact with MED1 in the appropriate cell context, depending on the cell type, the cell state, and the target gene regulatory region involved."

In solution FN1 occurs as a dimer. Binding to alpha5beta1 integrin stimulates FN1 self-association; blocking the RGD-cell binding domain of FN1 blocks fibril formation (Fogerty et al. 1990). FN1 binding is believed to induce integrin clustering, which promotes FN1-FN1 interactions. Integrin clustering is mediated by association between integrins and intracellular actin stress fibers (Calderwood et al. 2000). Binding of integrins to each of the monomers in the FN1 dimer pair is thought to trigger a conformational change in FN1 that exposes 'cryptic' FN1 binding sites that allow additional fibronectin dimers to bind without the requirement for pre-association with integrins (Singh et al. 2010). This non-covalent interaction may involve interactions with fibrillin (Ohashi & Erickson 2009). I1-5 functions as a unit that is the primary FN matrix assembly domain (Sottile et al. 1991) but other units are likely to be involved (Singh et al. 2010).

The vesicle is held in close apposition to the plasma membrane by several proteins that bridge the synaptic vesicle to the plasma membrane. Some of these proteins are in the plasma membrane while others are in the synaptic vesicle.

In addition, TANK is thought to act synergistically with IKK epsilon or TBK1 to link them to IKK complex via interaction with NEMO (IKK gamma), where TBK1/IKK epsilon may modulate NFkB activation (Chariot A et al. 2002). TANK influence on NFkB activation was found to occur via either positive or negative regulation (Guo B and Cheng G 2007, Konno H et al. 2009; Pomerantz JL and Baltimore D 1999; Kawagoe T et al. 2009).<p> Two other adaptor proteins NAK-associated protein 1 (NAP1) and SINTBAD (not shown here) have been implicated in TBK1/IKKepsilon-mediated activation of IRF3 (Sasai M et al. 2005; Ryzhakov G and Randow F 2007).

While HSP70 production was not altered in unstressed cells, the treatment with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) increased the HSP70 level in A431 cells and reached even higher expression level in HSF1-transfected A431 cells (Ding XZ et al. 1997).

In humans, nucleolytic activity is proposed to be involved in generating the G-rich 3' single strand overhang. In addition, differences in the structure of the overhang at telomeres that have undergone leading vs. lagging strand replication suggest that DNA processing may be different at these telomeres (Chai et al. 2006). <br> Electron microscopy studies of purified human telomeric DNA have provided evidence for telomeric loops, or t-loops (Griffith et al. 1999). t-loops are proposed to result from invasion of the 3' G-rich single strand overhang into the double stranded portion of the telomeric TTAGGG repeat tract. The strand displaced by invasion forms a structure called a D loop. The function of the t-loop is presumed to be the protection of the 3' telomeric end. In vitro, the double strand telomeric DNA binding protein TRF2 can increase the frequency of t-loop formation. The prevalence of the t-loops in vivo is not known. <br> Many proteins associate with telomeric DNA. One complex that binds telomeres is called shelterin. Shelterin is a six-protein complex composed of TRF1 and TRF2, which can bind double-stranded telomeric DNA, POT1, which can bind single-stranded telomeric DNA, and three other factors, RAP1, TIN2, and TPP1 (reviewed in de Lange 2006 ""Telomeres""). Human telomeric DNA is also bound by nucleosomes (Makarov et al. 1993; Nikitina and Woodcock 2004).

Superior cervical ganglion (SCG) neurons, vascular smooth muscle (SM-11) cells, oligodendrocytes and CNS neurons (including basal forebrain neurons) (Volosin et al, 2006) express significant levels of sortilin and p75NTR. Schwann cells, instead, do not express sortilin. It is expressed during embryogenesis in areas where NGF and proNGF have well-characterized effects. It is important for proNGF signalling, but has little or no role on mature NGF initiated signalling. ProNGF preferentially binds to a p75NTR:sortilin complex, whereas mature NGF preferentially binds p75NTR alone. ProNGF binds to p75NTR with a dissociation constant (Kd) ~15-20 nM, and to sortilin with a Kd ~5 nM. In the presence of sortilin, proNGF binds to p75NTR with a Kd 0.2 nM. In contrast, mature NGF binds to p75NTR with a Kd of 1-2 nM, whereas it binds sortilin very weakly (Kd ~ 90 nM). Therefore, in the presence of sortilin, p75NTR binds more strongly to proNGF than to NGF, and proNGF signalling predominates. In the absence of sortilin, NGF binding is stronger than proNGF, and it is the mature NGF signalling that prevails. proNGF interacts with sortilin via its pro-domain, whereas the interaction with p75NTR is mediated by the mature domain."

These inhibitors display differential selectivity and inhibit kinase activity of their substrates by distinct mechanisms. For example, the first-generation PI3K inhibitor wortmannin (Wymann et al. 1996) covalently and irreversibly binds all classes of PI3K enzymes, as well as other kinases including mTOR, at a residue critical for catalytic activity. Although wortmannin is precluded from in vivo and clinical use due to its toxicity, it has proven to be a useful tool for in vitro laboratory studies. Newer inhibitors, such as BEZ235, are currently being investigated in Phase I clinical trials. BEZ235 is a dual pan-class I PI3K/mTOR inhibitor that blocks kinase activity by binding competitively to the ATP-binding pocket of these enzymes (Serra et al. 2008, Maira et al. 2008). BGT226 (Chang et al. 2011) and XL765 (Prasad et al. 2011) also inhibits both PI3K class I enzymes and mTOR. Other inhibitors in clinical trials, such as BKM120 (Maira et al. 2012), GDC0941 (Folkes et al. 2008, Junttila et al. 2009) and XL147 (Chakrabarty et al. 2012), are specific for class I PI3Ks and exhibit no activity against mTOR. Current research aims to identify isoform-specific PI3K inhibitors. Small molecule inhibitors that selectively inhibit PIK3CA (p110alpha), e.g. PIK-75 and A66, were used to study the role of p110alpha in signaling and growth of tumor cells (Knight et al. 2006, Sun et al. 2010, Jamieson et al. 2011, Utermark et al. 2012). The PIK3CB (p110beta) specific inhibitor TGX221 has been used in in vitro models of vascular injury (Jackson et al. 2005), and the TGX221 derivative KIN-193 has been shown to block AKT activity and tumor growth in mice with p110beta activation or PTEN loss (Ni et al. 2012). CAL-101 is a PIK3CD (p110delta) specific inhibitor that is being clinically investigated as a therapeutic for lymphoid malignancies (Herman et al. 2010). It is hoped that, in the future, more specific inhibitors, such as those targeting selective PI3K isoforms, will provide optimum treatment while minimizing unwanted side effects.

Fibromodulin and lumican bind the same site while the binding site for decorin is distinct (Hedbom & Heinegard 1993). All appear to be involved in collagen fibril formation and matrix assembly (Ameye & Young 2002, Kalamajski & Oldberg 2010). DCN consists of a core protein of approximately 40 kDa attached to a single chondroitin or dermatan sulfate glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chain. It interacts with collagen types I, II (Vogel et al. 1984), III (Witos et al. 2011), V (Whinna et al. 1993), VI (Bidanset et al. 1992) and XIV (Ehnis et al. 1997). It binds collagen I and II near the N-terminus, placing it at the 'd' band gap in the fibril structure (Kalamajski et al. 2007). The binding site for DCN on collagen XIV is in the NH2-terminal fibronectin type III repeat. In addition, an auxiliary binding site located COOH-terminally to this fibronectin type III repeat interacts with the glycosaminoglycan component of DCN. DCN binding regulates fibrillogenesis (Vogel et al. 1984, Orgel et al. 2006). One molecule of DCN interacts with four to six collagen molecules. The interaction is between collagen and the core protein, not the GAG chain, and is more likely to involve the monomeric, not dimeric form (Orgel et al. 2009). Fibronectin (Winnemoller et al. 1991) and thrombospondin-1 (Winnemoller et al. 1992) are also DCN interactors. DCN acts as a sink for all three isoforms of TGF-Beta, binding them when already bound to collagen (Markmann et al. 2000). Degradation of DCN by matrix metalloproteinases MMP-2, -3 or -7 results in release of TGF-beta (Imai et al. 1997).

Xenopus and zebrafish each have one FRAT gene, while the human and mouse genomes contains two and three, respectively (Jonkers et al, 1997; reviewed in van Amerongen and Berns, 2005). Frat proteins activate WNT signaling by binding to GSK3beta and inhibiting its phosphorylation of beta-catenin (Yost et al, 1998; van Amerongen et al, 2004). The interaction with GSK3beta is mediated by a highly conserved IKEA box in the C-terminal domain of FRAT (Yost et al, 1998; van Amerongen et al, 2004; Thomas et al, 1999). This region of FRAT is able to compete with AXIN for binding to GSK3beta, suggesting a model where FRAT is able to destabilize the destruction complex by abrogating the GSK3beta-AXIN interaction (Farr et al, 2000; Thomas et al, 1999; Fraser at el, 2002; Ferkey et al, 2002). This model is supported by structural studies showing that AXIN and FRAT bind to the same region on the surface of GSK3beta (Bax et al, 2001; Dajani et al, 2003). Endogenous FRAT1 has also been shown to interact with DVL3, and this reaction persists in a FRAT1 mutant lacking the GSK3beta-interacting domain (Li et al, 1999). FRAT proteins may thus help bridge between GSK3betas role in the destruction complex and its role in activating signaling in response to WNT.<br><br>Despite the apparent importance of FRAT proteins in beta-catenin-dependent signaling, a triple FRAT knockout mouse shows no readily evident defects in canonical signaling and, unlike the GBP knockout in Xenopus, no overt phenotypic defects (van Amerongen et al, 2005; Yost et al, 1989). The in vivo role and significance of the FRAT proteins in WNT signaling remains to be resolved; it is worth noting, however, that FRAT proteins have also recently been shown to be involved in non-canonical WNT signaling in a GSK3beta-independent manner. It is possible that it is through this non-canonical role that FRAT proteins contribute to oncogenesis (van Amerongen et al, 2010; Walf-Vorderw_lbecke et al, 2012)."

The accumulation of hTERC that has undergone this processing event requires a conserved region of sequence termed the box H/ACA motif (Mitchell et al. 1999a). This motif is bound by a complex containing dyskerin, and mutations in dyskerin affect the processing and accumulation of hTERC (Mitchell et al. 1999b; Mitchell and Collins 2000; Fu and Collins 2003). Recent studies of purified, catalytically active telomerase indicate that the minimal structure that has telomerase activity in vitro is a complex of one molecule of hTERC RNA and two each of hTERT and DKC1 (dyskerin) proteins (Cohen et al. 2007). Several additional proteins may associate with this minimal complex and modulate its activity. RUVBL1 (pontin), RUVBL2 (reptin), and TCAB1 (telomere Cajal body protein 1) are found associated with human telomerase RNPs purified from HeLa cells, and activities of these proteins are required for telomerase RNP assembly in vivo (Venteicher et al. 2008, 2009). NHP2 (NOLA2) is likewise associated with telomerase ribonucleoprotein complexes (Pogacic et al. 2000) and homozygosity for NHP2 mutations is associated with telomerase failure (dyskeratosis congenita) in humans (Vuillamy et al. 2008). The exact roles of the additional proteins in the assembly and function of telomerase RNP in vivo remain unclear, however, so they are annotated simply as positively regulating telomerase RNP formation.<br><br><br>The core components hTERC and hTERT undergo trafficking in the cell that may be important for telomerase function. hTERC has been found localized in multiple nuclear structures, including Cajal bodies, nucleoli, and at telomeres (Mitchell et al. 1999a; Jady et al. 2004; Zhu et al. 2004; Jady et al. 2006; Tomlinson et al. 2006). hTERT is also reported localize in Cajal bodies, nucleoli, and to associate with telomeres (Etheridge et al. 2002; Wong et al. 2002; Yang et al. 2002; Zhu et al. 2004; Tomlinson et al. 2006). Some of the factors that regulate trafficking of these two core components of telomerase have been identified, such as nucleolin (Khurts et al. 2004), SMN (Bachand et al. 2002), and 14-3-3 (Seimiya et al. 2000). Cytological studies of HeLa cells suggest that the localization of the telomerase core components can change through the cell-cycle (Jady et al. 2006; Tomlinson et al. 2006). Despite these studies, it is not clear in which compartment hTERT and hTERC assemble to form functional telomerase RNP.<br><br><br>The assembly of telomerase involves the chaperone proteins p23 and Hsp90, which stably associate with telomerase in vitro (Holt et al. 1999; Forsythe et al. 2001; Keppler et al. 2006). A number of other proteins interact with the telomerase RNP, but it is not clear if they play a role in telomerase assembly.

TGF-beta is secreted from cells in latent form as part of a complex that includes two other proteins: the cleaved propeptide of TGF beta, known as latency associated peptide (LAP), and a member of the latent TGF beta binding protein (LTBP) family. LTBPs are members of the fibrillin/LTBP superfamily, characterised by the presence of unique TGF-binding protein (TB) domains, also known as 8 cys domains as they contain eight characteristic cysteines (Ramirez & Sakai 2010). LTBPs are microfibril-associated, proteins that tether latent complexes of TGF-beta to microfibrils in the ECM (Taipale et al. 1996, Dallas et al. 2000, Isogai et al. 2003, Hyytiainen et al. 2004, Ono et al. 2009, Munger & Sheppard 2011).

ATR can subsequently phosphorylate and activate the checkpoint kinase Chk1, allowing further amplification of the checkpoint signal. The ATR and Chk1 kinases then modify a variety of factors that can lead to stabilization of stalled DNA replication forks, inhibition of origin firing, inhibition of cell cycle progression, mobilization of DNA repair factors, and induction of apoptosis. This checkpoint signaling mechanism is highly conserved in eukaryotes, and homologues of ATR and ATRIP are found in such organisms as S. cerevisiae (Mec1 and Ddc2, respectively), S. pombe (rad3 and rad26, respectively), and X. laevis (Xatr and Xatrip, respectively).<p>The ATR (ATM- and rad3-related) kinase is an essential checkpoint factor in human cells. In response to replication stress (i.e., stresses that cause replication fork stalling) or ultraviolet radiation, ATR becomes active and phosphorylates numerous factors involved in the checkpoint response including the checkpoint kinase Chk1. ATR is invariably associated with ATRIP (ATR-interacting protein) in human cells. Depletion of ATRIP by siRNA causes a loss of ATR protein without affecting ATR mRNA levels indicating that complex formation stabilizes the ATR protein. ATRIP is also a substrate for the ATR kinase, but modification of ATRIP does not significantly regulate the recruitment of ATR-ATRIP to sites of damage, the activation of Chk1, or the modification of p53.<p>While the ATR-ATRIP complex binds only poorly to RPA complexed with ssDNA lengths of 30 or 50 nt, binding is significantly enhanced in the presence of a 75 nt ssDNA molecule.

Under physiological conditions the monomers phase separate and coalesce into spherical packages (Clarke et al. 2006), a process known as coacervation. Packages of accumulated elastin are delivered to fibrillin-based fibres in a mechanism that is correlated with cell migration during embryonic development (Czirok et al. 2006). A transglutaminase cross-link between domain 4 of tropoelastin and domain 16 of fibrillin-1 (FBN1) may stabilize initial deposition (Clarke et al. 2005).

The C-terminal end of beta-catenin interacts with a wide range of general transcriptional activators and chromatin remodelers, while the N-terminal region recruits more WNT-specific activators including BCL9 and Pygopus (reviewed in Jessen et al, 2008). BCL9 proteins (2 in vertebrates, BCL9 and BCL9L) interact with both beta-catenin and the putative activator Pygo (also 2 in vertebrates, Pygo1 and Pygo2) and in this way function as a bridging molecule to promote WNT-dependent transcription (reviewed in Valenta et al, 2012).<br>BCL9 was identified as the gene overexpressed in a B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line (Willis et al, 1998) and was subsequently found to be homologous to Legless (Lgs), a Drosophila gene identified in a number of screens for components of the WNT signalling pathway (Kramps et al, 2002; Belenkaya et al, 2002; Thompson et al, 2002). Lgs and BCL9 have no recognizable protein motifs and share sequence similarity only in three short stretches of 30 amino acids termed homology domains (HD) 1-3 (Kramps et al, 2002; reviewed in Valenta et al, 2012). HD1 mediates the interaction with the N-terminal ARM domain of beta-catenin while HD2 is required for the recruitment of Pygo through its C-terminal plant homology domain (PHD) (Kramps et al, 2002; Sampietro et al, 2006, Sierra et al, 2006). Replacement of the PHD domain of Pygo with the beta-catenin-interacting HD2 domain of Lgs rescues the phenotype of both lgs and pygo deletion in Drosophila suggesting that the primary role of Lgs is the recruitment of Pygo (Kramps et al, 2002). Transcriptional activation by Pygo depends on the conserved tripeptide NPF in the N-terminal homology domain (NHD) (Kramps et al, 2002; Hoffmans and Basler, 2004; Hoffmans et al, 2005; St_deli and Basler, 2005).<br>In Drosophila, Lgs is essential for Wg signalling, and deletion of either Lgs or Pygo phenocopies armadillo (the Drosophila beta-catenin homologue) null mutants (Kramps et al, 2002; Thompson et al, 2002). In mammals, the requirement and roles for BCL9 and Pygo are both less strict and less completely understood. Unlike in Drosophila, disruption of the BCL9/Pygo branch in mammals has less impact on transcriptional activation than abrogation of beta-catenin-dependent signalling through the C-terminal tail (Valenta et al, 2011). Ablation of pygopus genes in mice does not phenocopy with loss of Wnt signaling (Song et al, 2007; Schwab et al, 2007; Li et al, 2007), and disruption of the BCL9/BCL9L beta-catenin interaction results in embryonic lethality three days later than in the case of complete disruption of beta-catenin-dependent transcription (Valenta et al, 2011). Mammalian BCL9 also has Pygo-independent roles in WNT signaling and has been shown to interact directly with other transcriptional co-activators such as CBP/p300 or TRRAP/GCN5 through its C-terminus (Sustmann et al, 2008). Finally, the PHD of Pygo is able to bind methylated histones, which may contribute to context-specific roles of the protein (Gu et al, 2009; Fielder et al, 2008; Kessler et al, 2009; Gu et al, 2012)."

Laminin knockouts prevent basement membrane assembly, arresting development at a much earlier stage than knockouts of other ECM components such as collagen IV, nidogens (entactin), perlecan or agrin (Yurchenko et al. 2004).

Mutant mouse and human cells that lack functional UNC93B1 showed disrupted signaling via the endosomal TLRs (Taneda K et al 2006; Fukui et al 2009; Kim YM et al 2008; Qi R et al 2010; Koehn J et al 2007). Furthermore, defects in the human gene encoding UNC93B1 are associated with the increased susceptibility to herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE) in children (Casrouge A et al 2006).<p>TLR7 and TLR9 compete for UNC931-dependent trafficking and under normal circumstances TLR9 predominates over TLR7. This preference for TLR9 is mediated by an N-terminal domain in UNC93B1 and is reversed to TLR7 if UNC93B1 loses the preferential N-terminal binding site via mutation of aspartate at position 34. Loss of binding to TLR9 and preferential association with TLR7 resulted in hyperresponsiveness to RNA ligands (Fukui et al 2009).<p>TLR3 appears to translocate to the endosomal compartment with equal efficiency regardless of the presence or absence of the N-terminal domain that mediates preference for TLR9. Thus, endosomal TLR trafficking is orchestrated by UNC93B1 which determines how efficiently each TLR is able to move from the ER to the endolysosomes to initiate host responses."

They bind to the Frizzled (FZD) family of seven-pass transmembrane proteins and initiate at least three different intracellular signaling pathways. Historically they were considered to be family B GPCRs but more recent phylogenetic classifications put them into a class of their own (e.g. Schioth & Fredriksson 2005). FZD members have been demonstrated to signal via Gi/o (Slusarski et al. 1997) but this is not considered to be the primary signaling mechanism for these receptors (Hsieh 2004). Instead they signal through the canonical/beta-catenin pathway, the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway and the Wnt/Ca2+ pathway. The canonical/beta-catenin pathway requires a co-receptor protein known as LDL5 or LDL6 (Tamai et al. 2000). <br>Most Wnt signaling has been attributed to the activation of FZD receptors but there is evidence of FZD-independent signaling (Mikels & Nusse 2006).

The released extracellular domain represents a binding protein for many potential ligands, including neurotrophins, pro-neurotrophin precursors, beta-amyloid. Shedding of the p75NTR extracellular region can be both constituve and stimulated. The constitutive shedding is dependent on signalling via the p38 MAP kinase. Shedding can be stimulated by the phorbol ester PMA, acting through protein kinase C and ERK activation, and by a tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor.

It is not understood with certainty how myosin X contributes to the mechanism of pseudopod extension. It selectively binds to actin bundle such that each head may bind, in an ATP-sensitive manner, to two adjacent actin filaments within the actin bundle. Myosin X hydrolyze ATP and converts this chemical energy to mechanical energy moving toward the plus end/barbed end of the actin filament facing towards the tip of the growing pseudopods (Araki 2006, Chavrier 2003, Watanabe et al 2010)."

The binding of Sema4D to plexin-B1 stimulates the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity of Met, leading to the phosphorylation of both Plexin-B1 and Met. The phosphorylation of the plexin-B1/Met complex induced by Sema4D is crucial for epithelial cell migration and invasive growth.

Substitution of Ser303 with alanine derepresses the transactivation domain such that the S303A mutant showed increased transcriptional activity in human and mouse cells (Knauf U et al. 1996; Kline MP & Morimoto RI 1997). Phosphorylation of HSF1 at Ser303 was mediated by glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) activity in human acute monocytic leukemia THP1 cells and mouse embryonic fibroblast NIH 3T3 cells (Chu B et al. 1996, 1998). However, the other group showed that GSK3 inhibits HSF1 activity in HeLa cells through a mechanism that is independent of Ser303 phosphorylation, thus suggesting that Ser303 may be phosphorylated by multiple MAPKs (Batista?Nascimento L et al. 2011). The phosphorylation at Ser303 in turn promoted HSF1 association with YWHAE (14-3-3 epsilon), which may be involved in the attenuation of HSF1 activity during recovery leading to accelerated cytoplasmic localization of HSF1 (Wang X et al. 2003, 2004).In addition, stress stimulated human K562 erythroleukemia cells showed enhanced level of sumoylation in the HSF1 regulatory domain at Lys298, which was positively regulated by Ser303 phosphorylation (Hietakangas V et al. 2003)."

Wang et al. using the porcine receptor found that phosphorylation at any of the positions they examined (all conserved in humans) was sufficient for STAT5 phosphorylation. While STAT5 activation requires phosphorylation of the distal region of GHR, this has no effect on STAT1 or STAT3 activation (Yi et al. 1996) suggesting different mechanisms. Mutation of Y332 to F in a truncated form of GHR with only the first 54 residues of the cytoplasmic domain had no effect on JAK2 activation or cell proliferation presumed to be mediated by ERK (Wang et al. 1995) so the significance of phosphorylation at this position is unclear. SHP2 binds to Y595 of rat GHR (identical numbering in humans) and to a lesser extent Y487; mutation of these residues impairs the association (Stofega et al. 2000).

The released HSF1 monomer is rapidly converted to a homotrimer (Baler R et al. 1993; Herbomel G et al 2013). Upon trimerization HSF1 undergoes significant conformational changes resulting in an assembly of a stable triple-stranded alpha-helical coiled-coil structure with the amino-terminal hydrophobic domains from individual monomeric units (Rabindran SK et al. 1993; Zuo J et al. 1994, 1995; Neef DW et al. 2013). Biochemical and structural analysis strongly suggest that the monomer-to-trimer transition is tightly regulated at several interdependent levels. Thus, HSPs and cofactors bind HSF1 monomers preventing trimerization (Zou J et al.1998; Guo Y et al. 2001). In addition, leucine zippers (LZ) in the trimerization domain (LZ1-LZ3) are thought to retain HSF1 in its inactive monomeric form by intramolecular coiled-coil interactions with LZ4 in the carboxyl-terminus of HSF1, while LZ interactions between trimerization domains of individual monomeric units facilitate homotrimerization (Rabindran SK et al. 1993; Zuo J et al. 1994, 1995; Neef DW et al. 2013). HSF1 flexible linker region between DNA binding domain and first LZ of the trimerization domain was also found to modulate the monomer-trimer equilibrium (Liu PCC and Thiele DJ 1999). Furthermore, intermolecular disulfide bonds between cysteine residues 36 and 103 were reported to stabilize HSF1 trimer, while intramolecular disulfide crosslink inhibited HSF1 oligomerization (Lu M et al. 2008, 2009). Moreover, redox regulatory mechanisms were shown to regulate thiol-disulfide exchange and the conformation and activity of mammalian HSF1 in response to stress (Manalo DJ et al. 2002; Ahn SG and Thiele DJ 2003).<p>A ribonucleoprotein complex containing translation elongation factor EEF1A1 (eEF1A) and a long non-coding RNA, HSR1 (heat shock RNA-1) was shown to mediate trimerization of HSF1 (Shamovsky I et al. 2006)."	eEF1A;HSF12013	8	adds_modification	"The MSL complex has histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity with a high specificity for histone H4 lysine-17 (H4K16) (Smith et al. 2000, 2005, Conrad et al. 2012).

In eukaryotes the SPT-ADA-GCN5 acetyltransferase (SAGA) complex has 19 subunits including TRRAP, ENY2, USP22 and subunits belonging to the ADA, SPT, TAF, and SGF group of proteins (Nagy et al. 2009). The ADA2A-containing (ATAC) complex shares with SAGA a core composed of KAT2A-TADA3 (ADA3)-CCDC101 (STAF36, SGF29) and either TADA2A (ADA2a) in ATAC, or TADA2B (ADA2b) in SAGA. ATAC complexes contain a second putative HAT, called CSRP2BP (ATAC2), and five other subunits; YEATS2, ZZZ3, MBIP, WDR5, and DR1 (NC2-Beta) (Guelman et al. 2009). CSRP2BP has weak HAT activity in vitro but it's main function is to maintain the structural integrity of ATAC (Guelman et al. 2009). At present, the biological function of the ATAC complex is not well understood. In vitro GCN5 acetylates mainly histone H3K14 (lysine-15 in the UniProt peptide which retains the initiating methionine), but when incorporated into the SAGA complex GCN5 becomes more efficient as an H3K14 acetylase and can also acetylate H3K9 and H3K18 (Brand et al. 1999, Grant et al. 1999), H3K23, and H3K27 (Kuo et al. 1996, Kuo & Andrews 2013). Drosophila ATAC mainly acetylates histone H4 (Ciurciu et al. 2006, Suganuma et al. 2008), suggested to be due to the presence of CSRP2BP in the complex (Suganuma et al. 2008) but different human ATAC preparations have exhibited a range of specificities with no clear difference between SAGA and ATAC (Guelman et al. 2009, Wang et al. 2008, Nagy et al. 2010). SAGA and ATAC complexes from mouse and human contain either GCN5 or PCAF in a mutually exclusive manner (Nagy et al. 2010, Krebs et al. 2010, Spedale et al. 2012).<br><br>The SAGA complex consists of KAT2A (hGCN5), TADA1 (STAF42), TADA2B (ADA2b), TADA3 (STAF54, ADA3), SUPT3H (SPT3), SUPT7L (STAF65G), TAF5L (PAF65B), TAF6L (PAF65A), TAF9 (TAFII31), TAF12 (TAFII20), TAF10 (TAFII31), TRRAP, SAP130 (Martinez et al. 2001), CCDC101, ATXN7, a factor termed STAF55 that cannot be identified, two further factors described as probable members that cannot be identified STAF46 and STAF60 (Nagy & Tora 2007) plus ATXN7L3, USP22, ENY2 (Zhao et al. 2008) and SUPT20H (Nagy et al. 2009)."

ANKLE2 (LEM4) binds the PP2A complex that contains the B55-alpha regulatory subunit and facilitates BANF1 dephosphorylation, but as ANKLE2 does not interact with BANF1 (BAF) directly, the exact mechanism has not been determined (Asencio et al. 2012)."

These apo-carboxylases are biotinylated to their active halo forms by the activity of biotin-protein ligase (HCLS) (Ingaramo & Beckett 2012, Hiratsuka et al. 1998, Bailey et al. 2010). HCLS is localised to the cytosol and mitochondrion so can perform this activity in either of these locations. Defects in HLCS causes holocarboxylase synthetase deficiency (HLCS deficiency aka biotin-responsive multiple carboxylase deficiency; MIM:253270). HLCS deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder whereby deficient HLCS activity results in reduced activity of multiple carboxylases. Symptoms include metabolic acidosis, organic aciduria, lethargy, hypotonia, convulsions and dermatitis (Suzuki et al. 2005). Propionyl-CoA carboxylase is most likely functional as a dodecamer, composed of six Btn-containing alpha subunits (PCCA) and six beta subunits (PCCB).

While Mib1 is abundantly expressed in embryos and adult tissues, Mib2 expression is limited to adult tissues only (Koo et al. 2005). Mouse Neurl was directly shown to ubiquitinate Jag1 but not other Notch ligands in vitro. N-terminal myristoylation targets Neurl to the plasma membrane and this is a prerequisite for Jag1 internalization (Koutelou et al. 2008). Mouse Neurl1b was shown to directly bind and ubiquitinate recombinant Xenopus Delta and to cooperate with Mib1 in Delta endocytosis (Song et al. 2006). Ubiquitination of NOTCH ligands by MIB and NEURL ubiquitin ligases triggers ligand endocytosis. Drosophila Neuralized needs to interact with membrane phosphoinositides through its phosphoinositide-binding motif to trigger endocytosis of ubiquitinated Delta (Skwarek et al. 2007). The pulling force model states that the endocytosis of ubiquitinated Notch ligands mechanically pulls the ligand-bound Notch receptor, exposing the S2 cleavage site and resulting in Notch receptor cleavage by ADAM10 and/or ADAM17 metalloproteases (Itoh et al. 2003). Using a cell-bead optical tweezers system to measure rupture force specific for cells expressing Dll1 bound to laser trapped Notch1 beads, it was shown that the mechanical force required for the activation of Notch signaling depends on ligand ubiquitination and subsequent clathrin-mediated endocytosis that involves dynamin, epsins and actin (Meloty-Kapella et al. 2012). Ligand endocytosis and recycling does not directly influence Dll1 and Notch1 interaction, except that it regulates the amount of ligand on the cell surface that is available to activate Notch (Shergill et al. 2012)."

Integrity of the intracellular domain of DLL1 was shown to be essential for the successful release of NOTCH2 intracellular domain, NICD2, in response to DLL1 binding (Shimizu et al. 2002). In Drosophila, ubiquitination of Delta and Serrate ligands is performed by either Mindbomb or Neuralized ubiquitin ligase. In mammals, there are two Mindbomb homologues, MIB1 and MIB2 and two Neuralized homologues, NEURL (also known as NEUR1) and NEURL1B (also known as NEUR2).

The association between DVL and CSNK2 may be enhanced upon WNT signaling, leading to increased levels of DVL phosphorylation (Willert et al, 2007)."

NCORs are largely unstructured platform proteins that act as a scaffold upon which the enzymatic machinery of the repression complex is built (Watson et al. 2012). They can recruit other deacetylases such as HDAC4 (Fischle et al. 2002), HDAC5, HDAC7 (Kao et al. 2000), Sirt1 (Picard et al. 2004), and via mSin3, HDAC1 (Heinzel et al. 1997, Nagy et al. 1997). The importance of these deacetylase enzymes is not yet established. It has been demonstrated HDAC3 was shown to be responsible for deacetylase activities associated with HDAC4 and HDAC7 (Fischle et al. 2002). Corepressor complexes are heterogeneous, context-specific and transient in nature, but in addition to HDAC3, some additional partners are regularly found in stoichiometric association with NCOR1/NCOR2 and are essential for repressive function.

The fusion is characterized by the formation of a trans SNARE complex in which SNAP 25, syntaxin and synaptobrevin along with VGLUT1, the glutamate transporter, synaptotagmin, and Rab3a either become a part of the plasma membrane or membrane delimited in the vesicular membrane. Vesicle fusion ultimately results in the release of the glutamate into the synaptic cleft."

KAT3A;H42013	8	adds_modification	"CREBBP (CBP) is named after its interaction with the CRE-binding protein CREB, though it interacts with many other proteins. It is thought to act as an integrator of signals from various pathways (Goodman & Smolik 2000), which compete for a limited amount of nuclear CREBBP. CREBBP and EP300 (p300) are closely related and have overlapping functions but also unique properties, particularly in vivo (Kalkhoven 2004). Both proteins form a physical bridge between DNA-binding transcription factors and the RNA polymerase II complex. Histones are believed to be the main acetylation targets of CREBBP and EP300, but their ability to acetylate and thereby regulate transcription factors such as p53 (Gu & Roeder 1997) is considered significant additional function (Kasper et al. 2006). <br><br>CREBBP has intrinsic histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity on lysine-13 of H2B, lysine-15 of H3 and lysine-9 of H4 (Bannister & Kouzarides 1996, Rekowski & Giannis 2010, Barrett et al. 2011). <br><br>Homozygous knockout of CREBBP results in embryonic lethality (Tanaka et al. 1997).

Slit 2 is cleaved within the EGF repeats, between EGF5 and EGF6, by unknown proteases. Cleavage of Slit proteins is evolutionarily conserved, although the molecular biological significance is unknown. The N-terminal fragment of Slit2 stimulates growth and branching of dorsal root ganglia (DRG) axons, and this activity is opposed by un-cleaved Slit. The stimulation of axon branching is mediated by Robo receptors. Additional functional differences between the full-length and N-terminal forms have been discovered in their abilities to repel different populations of axons and dendrites.

RB1 may be particularly important for targeting of the condensin II complex to centromeres (Manning et al. 2010). RB1 deficient cells exhibit chromosome condensation defects and are prone to aneuploidy caused by aberrant chromosomal segregation. Therefore, tumor suppressor role of RB1 is based both on E2F-dependent control of G1/S transition, as well as on E2F-independent maintenance of genomic stability through regulation of mitotic chromosome condensation (Longworth et al. 20008, Coschi et al. 2010, Manning et al. 2010).<br><br>The role of RB1 in the maintenance of genomic stability is supported by studies of the childhood eye cancer retinoblastoma and its precursor, retinoma. Retinoma, a quiescent precursor of malignant retinoblastoma with functional loss of both RB1 alleles, is genomically unstable (Dimaras et al. 2008). Also, while the majority of retinoblastoma tumors are caused by the loss-of-function of the tumor suppressor gene RB1, ~2% of retinoblastoma tumors in unilaterally affected patients are initiated by a high level amplification of MYCN gene, in the presence of two functional, unmutated RB1 alleles. These tumors, with normal RB1 and amplified MYCN show a much lower level of genomic instability than retinoblastoma tumors with RB1 loss-of-function (Rushlow et al. 2013)."

This complex structure is composed of numerous protein complexes and networks including: the constitutive centromere-associated network (CCAN) containing several sub-networks such as (CENP-H, I, K), (CENP-50/U, O, P, Q, R), the KMN network (containing KNL1, the Mis12 complex, and the Ndc80 complex), the chromosomal passenger complex, the mitotic checkpoint complex, the nucleoporin 107-160 complex and the RZZ complex. <br>At prometaphase, following breakdown of the nuclear envelope, the kinetochores of condensed chromosomes begin to interact with spindle microtubules. In humans, 15-20 microtubules are bound to each kinetochore (McEwen et al., 2001), and the attachment of 15 microtubules to the kinetochore is shown in this reaction. Recently, it was found that the core kinetochore-microtubule attachment site is within the KMN network and is likely to be formed by two closely apposed low-affinity microtubule-binding sites, one in the Ndc80 complex and a second in KNL1 (Cheeseman et al., 2006)."	microtubule;RPS27__CLASP2__BUB1__MAD1L1__SKA2__PLK1__SPDL1__Dynein__PP1CC__NDE1__SGO2__CENPF__B9D2__RANGAP1__NDEL1__TAO1__INCENP__RANBP2__SGO1__XPO1__RCC2__Elys__KIF2A__CENPA__PICH__NUDC__MCAK__SKA1__KIF18A__CENPE__EB1__Lis1__ZWINT__CLIP1__CDC20__TOG__KIF2B__CLASP12011	8	binds	BetaKlotho (KLB) and heparan sulfate (HS) are required for fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19)-dependent signaling through fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 (FGFR4) .

In rotary shadowing images TNC is seen as a symmetrical structure called a hexabrachion (Erickson & Iglesias 1984). This hexamer is formed from initial trimers (Kammerer et al. 1988). All members of the family are believed able to form trimers but only C, R and W have the extra cysteine required for form hexamers. All have amino-terminal heptad repeats, epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like repeats, fibronectin type III domain repeats, and a carboxyl-terminal fibrinogen-like globular domain (Hsia & Schwartzbauer 2005). TNC was the first of the family to be discovered and is the best characterised (Midwood et al. 2011). Its subunits vary greatly in size (between 190 and 330 kDa of the tenascin-C monomer) due to glycosylation and splicing isoforms (Joester & Faissner 1999). During embryonic development TNC is expressed in neural, skeletal, and vascular tissues. In adults it is detectable only in tendon and tissues undergoing remodeling processes such as wound repair and neovascularization, or in pathological processes such as inflammation and tumorigenesis. TNR forms dimers and trimers (Norenberg et al. 1992) and is expressed only in the developing and adult central nervous system. TNC and TNR-null mice (single and double knock-outs) have surprisingly normal gross phenotypes, but exhibit behavioural and wound healing abnormalities (Mackie & Tucker 1999, Montag-Sallaz & Montag 2003). TNX (termed tenascin-Y in chicken) is the largest member of the family and is widely expressed during development, but in adults is limited to musculoskeletal, cardiac, and dermal tissue. It can form trimers, though it lacks the amino-terminal cysteine residues involved in hexamer formation. It is clearly associated with a variant of a heritable connective tissue disorder known as Ehler-Danlos Syndrome, which is associated with fibrillar collagen defects (Burch et al. 1997, Mao et al. 2002). TNY is thought to be an avian orthologue of TNX (Chiquet-Ehrismann 2004). TNW, first identified in zebrafish (Weber et al. 1998), is the least well characterized member of the tenascin family. It forms trimers and is expressed in developing skeletal tissue, neural crest cells and kidney, a pattern that partially overlaps with TN-C. <br><br>TNC binds syndecan-3 (Salmivirta et al. 1991, Koyama et al. 1996) Syndecans are type I transmembrane proteins, with an N-terminal ectodomain that contains several consensus sequences for glycosaminoglycan attachment and a short C-terminal cytoplasmic domain. Syndecan-1 and -3 glycosaminoglycan attachment sites occur in two distinct clusters, one near the N-terminus and the other near the membrane-attachment site, separated by a proline and threonine-rich 'spacer'. Syndecan ectodomain sequences are poorly conserved in the family and between species, but the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains are highly conserved. Syndecan-1 and -3 form a subfamily. Syndecan-3 on the cell surface is frequently oligomeric (Asundi & Carey 1995).

There are conflicting reports regarding the requirement for the DVL PDZ domain in the WNT-dependent activation of RAC (Habas et al, 2003; Cajanek et al, 2013).

In some cases, RAC activation correlates with activation of the downstream effector c-Jun N terminal kinase (JNK). This is thought to regulate reorganization of the cytoskeleton, however the mechanism of JNK activation is unknown. In other cases, JNK activation appears to be dispensable to the WNT response (Yamanaka et al, 2002; Habas et al, 2003; Rosso et al, 2005; reviewed in Heaseman and Ridley, 2008; Lai et al, 2009)"	Dvl-1__pp-DVL3__pp-DVL2;RAC__GTP2013	8	binds	"DAAM1 (Dishevelled-associated activator of morphogenesis) is a formin-homology protein that was identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen for interactors with the DVL PDZ domain (Habas et al, 2001).

In addition, differences in the structure of the overhang at telomeres that have undergone leading vs. lagging strand replication suggest that DNA processing may be different at these telomeres (Chai et al. 2006). <P> Many proteins associate with telomeric DNA. One complex that binds telomeres is called shelterin. Shelterin is a six-protein complex composed of TRF1 and TRF2, which can bind double-stranded telomeric DNA, POT1, which can bind single-stranded telomeric DNA, and three other factors, RAP1, TIN2, and TPP1 (reviewed in de Lange 2006 ""Telomeres""). Human telomeric DNA is also bound by nucleosomes (Makarov et al. 1993; Nikitina and Woodcock 2004).

Endorphins are processed from the precursor proopiomelanocortin (POMC) (Takahashi H et al, 1981), which can also be processed to yield adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and alpha- and gamma-melanocyte stimulating hormone (MSH). Beta-endorphin (Dragon N et al, 1977) is a 31 amino acid peptide found in neurons of the hypothalamus and pituitary gland. It is released into the blood (from the pituitary gland) and into the spinal cord and brain from hypothalamic neurons during vigourous exercise, excitement and orgasm. Beta-endorphin binds with the highest affinity to the mu-opioid receptor but it also possesses some affinity towards the delta- and kappa-opioid receptors. Once bound, it acts as an analgesic in the body by dulling pain. It does this by breaking down bradykinins which are peptides which accumulate in response to injury. The mu-opioid receptor (MOR) (Wang JB et al, 1994) possesses high affinity for enkephalins and beta-endorphin but low affinity for dynorphins.<br>The enkephalins are endogenous ligands, or specifically endorphins, as they are internally derived and bind to the body's opioid receptors. There are two forms of enkephalin, one containing leucine (""leu""), while the other contains methionine (""met""). The met-enkephalin peptide sequence is coded by the POMC gene whereas leu-enkephalin is coded by both POMC and dynorphin genes. Enkephalins are pentapeptides involved in regulating pain and nociception in the body. Their action is mediated through the delta-opioid receptor (DOR) (Knapp RJ et al, 1994).<br>Dynorphins constitute a class of opioid peptides that arise from the precursor protein prodynorphin. When prodynorphin is cleaved during processing by proprotein convertase 2 (PC2), multiple active peptides are released, amongst which are dynorphin A, dynorphin B, big-dyn and alpha/beta-neoendorphin (Day R et al, 1998). Dynorphins primarily exert their effects through the kappa-opioid receptor (KOR), a G-protein coupled receptor (Simonin F et al, 1995). Two subtypes of KORs have been identified: K1 and K2. Although KOR is the primary receptor for all dynorphins (James IF et al, 1982), the peptides do have some affinity for MOR and DOR."

The persistent nature of this RPA-ssDNA complex (as opposed to a more-transient complex found at an active replication fork) allows it to serve as a signal for replication stress that can be recognized by the ATR-ATRIP and Rad17-Rfc2-5 complexes.<p>RPA associates with ssDNA in distinct complexes that can be distinguished by the length of ssDNA occluded by each RPA molecule. These complexes reflect the progressive association of distinct DNA-binding domains present in the RPA heterotrimeric structure. Binding is coupled to significant conformational changes within RPA that are observable at the microscopic level. Presumably, the different conformations of free and ssDNA-bound RPA allow the protein to selectively interact with factors such as ATR-ATRIP when bound to DNA."

Cells with mutated MMS19 are hypersensitive to DNA damage and have elongated telomeres therefore these target proteins are relevant to various cancer-related diseases and aging."

In general, exocytosis proceeds by formation of a ""SNARE pair"", a complex between a SNARE-type protein on the granule and a SNARE-type protein on the plasma membrane. (The interaction is between coiled coil domains on each SNARE-type protein.)<p>In the particular case of insulin granules in beta cells, the SNARE protein on the granule is Synaptobrevin2/VAMP2 and the SNARE protein on the plasma membrane is Syntaxin1A in a complex with SNAP-25. Unc18-1 binds Syntaxin1A and thereby prevents association with Synaptobrevin2 until dissociation of Unc18-1. Syntaxin 4 is also involved and binds filamentous actin but its exact role is unknown.<br>Insulin exocytosis occurs in two phases: 1) a rapid release of about 100 of the 1000 docked granules within the first 5 minutes of glucose stimulation and 2) a subsequent slow release over 30 minutes or more due to migration of internal granules to the plasma membrane. Data from knockout mice show that Syntaxin 1A is involved in rapid release but not slow release, whereas Syntaxin 4 is involved in both types of release.<p>Calcium dependence of membrane fusion is conferred by Synaptotagmin V, which binds calcium ions and associates with the Syntaxin1A-Synaptobrevin2 pair. The exact mechanism of Synaptotagmin's action is unknown. The migration of internal granules to the plasma membrane during slow release is also calcium dependent.<p>Microscopically, exocytosis is seen to occur as a ""kiss and run"" process in which the membrane of the secretory granule fuses transiently with the plasma membrane to form a small pore of about 4 nm between the interior of the granule and the exterior of the cell. Only a portion of the insulin in a granule is secreted after which the pore closes and the vesicle is recaptured back into the cell. Dynamin-1 and NSF may play a role in recapture but the mechanism is not fully known.<p>The major effect of adrenaline and noradrenaline on insulin secretion is the inhibition of exocytosis of pre-existing insulin secretory granules. The inhibition occurs at a ""distal site"", that is, the effect is most pronounced on granules already near the cytosolic face of the plasma membrane. The effect is caused by the Gi/o alpha:GTP complex but the exact mechanism by which Gi/o alpha:GTP inhibits exocytosis is unknown. On release, the higher pH in the extracellular region favours dissociation of Zn2+ from insulin.

The reorganization of heterochromatin into SAHFs is accompanied by reduction in the amount of total and chromatin-bound lamin B1 (LMNB1), and high levels of LMNB1 interfere with SAHF formation (Sadaie et al. 2013). High-mobility group A proteins, HMGA1 and HMGA2, are enriched on chromatin of senescent cells, predominantly localizing to SAHFs, and high HMGA1 and HMGA2 levels, in cooperation with p16-INK4A, promote SAHF formation and repression of E2F target genes in senescent cells. Overexpression of CDK4 and MDM2, which are frequently co-amplified with HMGA2 in cancer cells as a part of 12q13-15 chromosomal band amplification, bypasses HMGA2 and HMGA1 induced cell cycle arrest and SAHF formation (Narita et al. 2006). The accumulation of HMGA proteins on senescent cell chromatin and SAHF formation is accompanied by the loss of the linker histone H1, probably due to a posttranslational mechanism (Funayama et al. 2006). A chromatin remodeling protein EP400 (p400), which is able to bind CDKN1A (p21) promoter and inhibit TP53-mediated activation of CDKN1A transcription, negatively regulates SAHF formation (Chan et al. 2005)."

PKA has several functions in the cell, including regulation of glycogen, sugar, and lipid metabolism. PKA is a holoenzyme complex consisting of two regulatory and two catalytic subunits. When cAMP levela are low the holoenzyme remains intact and is inactive. When the concentration of cAMP rises (e.g. as a result of adenylate cyclase activation by G protein-coupled receptors coupled to Gs, or inhibition of phosphodiesterases that degrade cAMP) cAMP binds to two binding sites on the regulatory subunits, leading to the release and activation of the catalytic subunits. The regulatory subunits of PKA are also important for localizing the kinase inside the cell. A-kinase anchor proteins (AKAPs) bind to the regulatory subunits and to cytoskeletal structures or membranes, anchoring the enzyme complex to a particular subcellular compartment. Dual-specificity A kinase-anchoring proteins (AKAP1/D-AKAP1) and (AKAP10/D-AKAP2) interact with the type I and type II regulatory subunits of PKA (Huang et al. 1997). AKAP10 additionally has two regulator of G-protein signaling (RGS) domains, giving it the potential to coordinate a signaling complex that links cAMP signaling with G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling (Burns-Hamuro et al. 2004)."

The PS sequence resembles an ideal substrate with the exception that it contains an alanine residue instead of a substrate serine residue, is bound to the kinase domain in the resting state. As a result, PKC is maintained in a closed inactive state, which is inaccessible to cellular substrates (Colon-Gonzalez & Kazanietz 2006). Diacylglycerol (DAG) produced by activated lipins (LPIN1, LPIN2, LPIN3) leads to the activation of PKC (PRKCA and PRKCB) and their translocation from the nucleoplasm to the nuclear envelope where they can phosphorylate lamins (Mall et al. 2012). PKCs are tethered to the membrane through DAG binding to the C1 domain and this confers a high-affinity interaction between PKC and the membrane. This leads to a massive conformational change that releases the PS domain from the catalytic site and the system becomes both competent and accessible (Colon-Gonzalez & Kazanietz 2006)."

There are indications that it can signal via G-proteins Gi and G12/13 (Ruiz-Gomez, 2007) but this role is poorly understood. It's better characterised physiological role is as the transducer of hedgehog (HH) signaling. In this capacity Smo is not acting as a receptor, but as part of a signaling cascade. <br> <br> The Hedgehog(HH)/Smo signalling pathway was identified as a key component of Drosophila development and subsequently found to be conserved in all meatazoans. Most of the functions attributed to Smo are associated with development such as digit patterning in the chick limb bud and leftright asymmetry of vertebrate embryos. In addition, Smo appears to be involved in homeostasis; deregulated Smo signaling is implicated in tumorogenesis (Ruiz-Gomez, 2007). <br> <br> The ligand of the 12 transmembrane-domain receptor Patched (Ptc) is Hedgehog(HH) but in the absence of HH, Ptc binds Smo (Stone et al. 1996) which consequently becomes internalised into endosomes, where it associates with Costal-2 (Cos2), and lysosomes, where it is degraded. This 'inactivates' Smo by preventing the formation of an active Smo signaling complex at the plasma membrane. Internalised Smo:Cos2 forms a complex with protein kinase A (PKA), casein kinase I (CKI) glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3) and Cucurbitus interruptus (Ci), a transcriptional regulator, enabling phosphorylation of Ci and subsequent processing to a transcriptional repressor form (CiR). When HH binds to Ptc, it does not bind Smo, allowing Smo to undergo a conformational change, exposing a new surface in its cytoplasmic tail. This causes PKA, CKI and GSK3 to dissociate from Smo:Cos2 complexes, so that Ci is no longer phosphorylated or processed to CiR. Accumulating Smo is phosphorylated instead and assumes a third conformational state. Phosphorylated Smo trafficks to the plasma membrane (Denef et al. 2000) and assembles into a signalling complex that promotes the phosphorylation of Fused (Fu) and Cos2. Phosphorylated Cos2 dissociates from membranes and recruits Fu to Sufu (Suppressor of Fused), which produces the activated form of Ci (CiA), probably through phosphorylation of Sufu (Hooper & Scott, 2005)."

PLK1 phosphorylates GORASP1 on serine residue S189 (Sengupta and Linstedt 2010). This serine residue is near the GORASP1 region involved in GORASP1 dimerization and oligomerization, a process underlying the stacking of cis-Golgi cisternae (Wang et al. 2003). The phosphorylation of S189 by PLK1 impairs Golgi cisternae stacking (tethering), contributing to Golgi unlinking and fragmentation in mitosis, probably by preventing formation of GORASP1 dimers and oligomers (Sutterlin et al. 2001, Sengupta and Linstedt, 2010).

In humans, this large complex contains the tubulin superfamily member gamma-tubulin,five gamma complex proteins (GCP2-GPC6) and NEDD1/GCP-WD. A current model of the arrangement of subunits within the gamma-TuRC proposes that 6-7 TuSC subcomplexes are held together by the other Grip proteins (at an unknown stoichiometry), which together form the cap subunits. In many animal cells, the recruitment of gamma-tubulin complexes to the centrosome rapidly increases (35 fold ) before mitosis to support the formation of new spindle microtubules (Khodjakov and Rieder 1999). NEDD1/GCP-WD plays an essential role in recruitment of these complexes to the centrosomes (Haren et al., 2006; Luders et al., 2006) and to the mitotic spindle (Luders et al., 2006). GCP-WD/NEDD1 associates directly with the gamma-TuRC. The carboxy-terminal half binds to the gamma-TuRC whereas the amino-terminal half, corresponding to the WD-repeat domain, is responsible for its attachment to the centrosome (Haren et al., 2006). Additional centrosomal proteins have also been implicated in the docking of gamma-TuRC to the centrosomes. CG-NAP/AKAP450 and kendrin are necessary for the initiation of microtubule nucleation and interact with GCP2/GCP3 and GCP2, respectively (Takahashi et al., 2002).

The binding of ligand to integrin is also dependent on divalent cations (usually Mn++ or Mg++or Ca++). A conserved motif, the metal ion-dependant adhesion site (MIDAS) is located in the alpha and the beta chains that coordinate the divalent cation at the top of the domain. <br>Active integrin alphaIIb beta3 interacts with a variety of plasma proteins such as fibrinogen, vWF, thrombin, thrombospondin, and fibronectin.

In the absence of a WNT signal AXIN is phosphorylated at Thr519 and Ser524 by GSK3beta and at Ser531 by an unknown kinase. Mutation of these sites decreases the binding to beta-catenin and results in increased TCF-dependent signaling (Jho et al, 1999).<br> <br><br>The destruction complex phosphatase PP2A has been implicated as both a positive and negative regulator of WNT and is a candidate for the WNT-dependent dephosphorylation of AXIN (Willert et al, 1999; reviewed in Kimelman and Xu, 2006; MacDonald et al, 2009). Stimulation of the WNT pathway leads to changes in AXIN mobility that are reproduced in vitro by dephosphorylation of immunoprecipitated AXIN by PP2A. Consistent with this, treatment of cells with the PP2A inhibitor okadaic acid blocks the dephosphorylation of AXIN upon treatment with WNT3A (Willert et al, 1999). Stimulation of the WNT pathway results in the recovery of less AXIN in a beta-catenin pulldown, and the AXIN that is isolated in this way is exclusively the phosphorylated form (Willert et al, 1999). In addition to dephosphorylating AXIN, PP2A has also been shown to dephosphorylate beta-catenin itself (Su et al, 2008). <br><br>Another candidate for the dephosphorylation of AXIN is PP1. PP1 interacts with AXIN and PP1-dependent dephosphorylation of AXIN decreases the AXIN-GSK3beta interaction and inhibits beta-catenin phosphorylation (Luo et al, 2007). <br>"	CTNNB1;AXIN12012	8	adds_modification	"After cross linking, Fc gamma receptors are sequestered to lipid rafts where they are complexed with some of the tyrosine kinases of Src family and undergo phosphorylation on the tyrosine residues contained in conserved ITAM sequences.

Residue numbering here refers to the UniProt canonical sequence.<br><br>MMP2 processing by MMP14 or MMP16 is very inefficient unless the MT-MMP has pre-bound TIMP2, which in turn binds MMP2. Physiological concentrations of TIMP2 enhance MMP2 binding, but higher concentrations inhibit proMMP2 activation (Butler et al. 1998, Kinoshita et al. 1998), indicating that MT-MMP:TIMP2 complexes bind MMP2, but local free MT-MMP subsequently cleaves the TIMP-bound proMMP2. In vivo the majority of MMP14 is bound to TIMP2 and functions as a receptor for proMMP2 (Nishida et al. 2008). In contrast, activation of proMMP2 by MMP15 occurs in a TIMP independent manner, with TIMP2 inhibiting activation at all concentrations (Morrison et al. 2001). Native type I collagen binds to the hemopexin C domain of MMP14, and following clustering of the enzyme together enhances proMMP2 activation (Tam et al. 2002). However, proMMP2 also binds the cell via cell surface Beta1 integrin, which binds native type I collagen which in turn is bound by the fibronectin type II modules of MMP2, preventing activation by MMP14 (Steffensen et al. 1998).

UPF1 also contains additional serine and threonine residues that could be phosphorylated. SMG8 and SMG9 associate with SMG1 and regulate the kinase activity of SMG1 (Yamashita et al. 2009). The phosphorylation reaction is rate-limiting in nonsense-mediated decay and is therefore regarded as a licensing step (reviewed in Rebbapragada and Lykke-Andersen 2009). Phosphorylation is enhanced by the exon junction complex, which can interact with UPF1 via UPF2 and/or UPF3 (Kashima et al. 2006, Ivanov et al. 2008) or via Y14:Magoh (Ivanov et al. 2008).

LCN2 binds iron through association with 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (2,5DHBA), a siderophore that shares structural similarities with bacterial enterobactin, and delivers or removes iron from the cell, depending on the context. The iron-bound form of LCN2 (holo-LCN2) is internalised following binding to the solute carrier family 22 member 17 (SLC22A17) receptor, leading to release of iron which increases intracellular iron concentration and subsequent inhibition of apoptosis. This step is inferred from experiments using the highly homologous 24p3 mouse lipocalin and 24p3R mouse cell surface receptor (Devireddy et al. 2005). During infection, bacteria scavenge iron from the host cell and transfer it to the pathogen cell. Upon encountering invading bacteria, Toll-like receptors on immune cells can stimulate the transcription, translation and secretion of LCN2. LCN2 can then limit bacterial growth by sequestrating the iron-laden siderophore so this event is pivotal in the innate immune response to bacterial infection (Flo et al. 2004)."

A more recent model suggests that AXIN phosphorylation may disrupt an intramolecular interaction between its DIX domain and the beta-catenin binding region, which would otherwise keep AXIN in a 'closed' inactive state (Kim et al, 2013). Activation of the WNT pathway upon ligand binding favours dephosphorylation of AXIN by inactivating the kinases and allowing the steady state dephosphorylation by candidate phosphatases PP2A and PP1 to predominate (Willert et al, 1999; Luo et al, 2007; reviewed in Saito-Diaz et al, 2013)."

The steps leading to the Jun, NF kappaB, or apoptotic pathways are rife with modulation."	TRADD;RIPK12004	8	binds	"NOTCH1 is activated by JAG1 ligand expressed on a neighboring cell. Based on mouse studies, activation of NOTCH1 by JAG1 may be important in angiogenesis (Benedito et al. 2009). In addition, human JAG1 was shown to inhibit granulocytic differentiation of 32D mouse myeloid progenitors expressing Notch1 (Li et al. 1998)."
