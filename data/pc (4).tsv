2012	8	adds_modification	SLP-76 lacks intrinsic catalytic activity and acts as a scaffold, recruiting other proteins for correct localization during molecular signal transduction (Bogin et al. 2007). Activation of FCERI leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of SLP-76 (Gross et al. 1999). SLP-76 has three potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites within its amino terminus region: Y113, Y128, and Y145. Phosphorylation may be mediated by SYK, analogous to the role of ZAP-70 in phosphorylating T-cell SLP-76 (Bubeck-Wardenberg et al. 1996).	p-6Y-SYK;LCP2
2012	8	adds_modification	BTK/ITK are activated in a two step model. In the first step they are recruited to the membrane by binding to PIP3 or, alternatively with other binding partners like SLP-76. Once at the membrane SYK or Src-kinases in the vicinity phosphorylates Y551 (Y512 in ITK) in the activation loop of the catalytic domain of BTK to fully activate it (Rawlings et al. 1996, Park et al. 1996, Kawakami et al. 1994).	p-6Y-SYK;TEC

2012	8	adds_modification	SHC is an adapter protein that has been implicated in Ras activation. Mast cells express two isoforms of 46 and 52 kDa. Both isoforms of SHC have two domains, an N-terminal phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain and a C-terminal SH2 domain that allows Shc to bind to proteins containing phosphorylated tyrosine residues. Following receptor stimulation, SHC is phosphorylated by Src kinases Syk on Y239, Y240 and Y317 (p56 isoform). Both phosphotyrosines Y239 and Y317 creates the binding site for the SH2 domain of GRB2.	p-6Y-SYK;SHC1
2012	8	adds_modification	NTAL and LAT play complementary roles in the positive regulation of FCERI-mediated degranulation. Upon FCERI aggregation NTAL is phosphorylated by LYN, SYK and KIT on different tyrosines. Phosphorylated NTAL likely contributes to the activation of mast cells by providing docking sites for the recruitment of critical signaling molecules into the lipid raft. There are about ten tyrosines in LAT2 of which five tyrosines principally phosphorylated by SYK are recognised as putative GRB2-binding sites, being part of a YXN motif, whereas LYN and KIT phosphorylate both tyrosines contained in the YXN motifs as well as tyrosines outside of the YXN motifs (Iwaki et al. 2008).	p-6Y-SYK;NTAL
2012	8	adds_modification	LAT is palmitoylated and membrane-associated adaptor protein. It rapidly becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated upon receptor engagement. LAT has nine conserved tyrosine residues of which five have been shown to undergo phosphorylation (Y127, Y132, Y171, Y191 and Y226). Src family kinases, SYK and ZAP-70 efficiently phosphorylate LAT on these tyrosine residues (Jiang & Cheng 2007, Paz et al. 2001). Phosphorylation of LAT creates binding sites for the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain proteins PLC-gamma1, GRB2 and GADS, which indirectly bind SOS, VAV, SLP-76 and ITK (Wange 2000).	p-6Y-SYK;LAT

2013	8	adds_modification	PLK1 phosphorylates FOXM1 on serine residues S730 and S739 (S715 and S724 in FOXM1B isoform) in the C-terminal transactivation domain (TAD). PLK1-mediated phosphorylation of FOXM1 upregulates FOXM1 transcriptional activity and is crucial for FOXM1 function at G2/M transition (Fu et al. 2008).	p-T611-FOXM1__p-T210-PLK1;FOXM1
2012	8	translocation	Ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase UCHL5 (UCH37) deubiquitinates TGFBR1, stabilizing TGF-beta receptor complex and prolonging TGF-beta receptor signaling. Deubiqutination of SMAD7 by UCHL5 has not been examined in this context (Wicks et al. 2005). Ubiquitin peptidase USP15 also deubiquitinates and stabilizes TGFBR1, leading to enhanced signaling by TGF-beta receptor complex. USP15 does not affect the ubiquitination status of SMAD7. Amplification of USP15 has recently been reported in glioblastoma, breast and ovarian cancer. In advanced glioblastoma, TGF-beta receptor signaling acts as an oncogenic factor, and USP15-mediated upregulation of TGF-beta receptor signaling may be a key factor in glioblastoma pathogenesis (Eichhorn et al. 2012). The role of UCHL5 was inferred from experiments using recombinant mouse Uchl5 and Smad7 with recombinant human TGF-beta receptors. The role of USP15 was established by experiments using human proteins.	UCHL5/USP15;UBC

2012	8	adds_modification	CARMA1 (CARD11/Caspase recruitment domain-containing protein 11), BCL10 (B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 10) and MALT1 (Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation protein 1)/paracaspase have been identified as signaling components that act downstream of PKC-theta. CARMA1 is a scaffold protein and recruits BCL10, MALT1, PKC and TRAF6 to form a multi protein complex. CARMA1 exists in an inactive conformation in which the linker region binds to and blocks the accessibility of the CARD motif. Upon stimulation S552 and S645 linker residues are phosphorylated by PKC-theta and this may weaken this interaction, inducing an open conformation of CARMA1. Further phosphorylation studies have revealed other phosphorylation sites (S109, S551 and S555) that may also promote activation of CARMA1. Serene/threonine kinases PKC-beta, IKKbeta, HPK1 and CaMKII are involved in triggering CARMA1 activation (Thome et al. 2010, Rueda & Thome 2005). (only phosphorylated S552 and S645 are represented in this reaction)	DAG__p-5Y-PKC-theta;CAR11

2010	8	translocation	MyD88 and Tollip only bind to non-phosphorylated IRAK1 [Wesche et al. 1997) so hyper-phosphorylated IRAK1 is predisposed to release from the receptor complex, a key step in this signaling cascade. It is believed that the interaction of IRAK1 with TRAF6 enables the release of IRAK1:TRAF6 from the receptor (Gottipati et al. 2007). Though released from the receptor complex, IRAK1:TRAF6 remains associated with the membrane, perhaps due to subsequent interaction with the TAK1 complex (Dong et al. 2006).	IRAK3;TOLIP

2012	8	adds_modification	In darkness, the G protein transducin (Gt) is attached to the disk membrane surface with a GDP bound to it and it is inactive. Gt is a heterotrimer of alpha1 (GNAT1) (van Dop et al. 1989, Fong 1992), beta1 (GNB1) (Codina et al. 1986) and gamma1 (GNGT1) (Tao et al. 1993) subunits. Photoactivated rhodopsin (MII or R*) catalyzes the exchange of GTP for GDP bound to Gt. Upon GTP/GDP exchange, Gt is released from MII and the Gt alpha with GTP bound (GNAT1 GTP) dissociates from Gt beta gamma subunits (GNB1:GNGT1). This mechanism was deciphered from bovine experiments (Pugh & Lamb 1993). MII proceeds to activate additional Gt molecules, making this reaction the first amplification step in the phototransduction cascade. A single activated rhodopsin molecule activates tens of Gt molecules. Although phosphorylation of activated rhodopsin (MII) by rhodopsin kinase (GRK1) reduces transducin activation (Khani et al. 1996), complete deactivation occurs only after arrestin (S-antigen or SAG, Yamaki et al. 1988) binds to and sterically caps MII.<br><br>Defects in GNAT1 cause the Nougaret type of autosomal dominant, congenital stationary night blindness (Dryja et al. 1996, CSNBAD3; MIM:610444) .

2003	8	removes_modification	Protein phosphatase 2A removes the phosphates from phosphorylated rhodopsin (p MII) and phosphorylated opsin (p-RHO) (Fowles et al. 1989, Palczewski et al. 1989a,b). A Ca2+ dependent opsin phosphatase is also present (Kutuzov & Bennett 1996). Serine/threonine protein phosphatases with EF hands (PPEF1 and 2) that share homology with Drosophila retinal degeneration C (rdgC) are expressed in retina and may be responsible (Huang & Honkanen 1998), there is no evidence for a physiological role in dephosphorylating rhodopsin. Once dephosphorylated, RHO can once again bind the chromophore 11 cis retinal (11cRAL), in readiness for the next photon response. Arrestin (S-antigen or SAG, Yamaki et al. 1988) binds to and sterically caps MII, preventing PPEF1 from dephosphorylating it.	PP7__Mg2+;OPSD

2008	8	adds_modification	PAK-2p34 is ubiquitinated prior to degradation (Jakobi et al., 2003). Here, ubiquitination of PAK-2p34 is described as occurring in the cytosol. However, to date it is not known whether this occurs in the nucleus or in the cytoplasm. Evidence for this reaction comes from experiments using both human and rabbit proteins. The polyubiquitin synthesized in the reaction is inferred to contain lysine-48 (K48) linkages because the modified protein is targeted to the proteasome (Komander 2009).	Ubiquitin ligase;PAK2

2003	8	adds_modification	The membrane associated cGMP phosphodiesterase 6 (PDE6) is a tetramer of two catalytic chains, alpha (PDE6A or PDEA) (Pittler et al. 1990) and beta (PDE6B or PDEB) (Weber et al. 1991), and two inhibitory gamma chains (PDE6G or PDEG) (Tuteja et al. 1990). Binding of an activated transducin alpha subunit (GNAT1-GTP) to PDE-gamma relaxes the inhibitory effect of the gamma subunit thereby activating the associated alpha or beta catalytic subunit. Because the binding of GNAT1-GTP to PDE-gamma is one to one, there is no amplification associated with this step. Active Gt alpha (GNAT-GTP) can be inactivated by a slow, intrinsic GTPase activity that hydrolyses GTP to GDP. Once GNAT1 has GDP bound, it no longer binds to the gamma subunit of PDE6 (PDE6-gamma) that then resumes inhibition of the catalytic subunit of PDE6. Some forms of autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa and congenital stationary night blindness are caused by mutations in PDE6 (https://sph.uth.edu/retnet/).<br>	GDP__N-ACYL-GNAT1;GNAT1

2013	8	adds_modification	Phosphorylation of NUP98 by NEK6 (and/or NEK7) promotes nuclear envelope permeabilization by initiating nuclear pore complex (NPC) disassembly. Two NUP98 serine residues, S591 and S822 (referring to NUP98 splice variant NUP98-4; these residues correspond to S608 and S839 of NUP98 splice variant NUP98-3), are phosphorylated on NUP98 isolated from mitotic HeLa cells (human cervical cancer cell line). These serine residues match the NEK6 target site consensus and are phosphorylated by NEK6 in vitro. Both sites can also be phosphorylated in vitro by NEK7 and weakly by NEK2. As NEK7 but not NEK2 was shown to be involved, with NEK6, in nuclear envelope permeabilization, NEK2 is not shown as the NUP98 kinase. Phosphorylated NUP98 dissociates from the NPC (Laurell et al. 2011).

Two NUP98 serine residues, S591 and S822 (referring to NUP98 splice variant NUP98-4; these residues correspond to S608 and S839 of NUP98 splice variant NUP98-3), are phosphorylated on NUP98 isolated from mitotic HeLa cells (human cervical cancer cell line). These serine residues match the NEK6 target site consensus and are phosphorylated by NEK6 in vitro. Both sites can also be phosphorylated in vitro by NEK7 and weakly by NEK2.

MNK1 appears not to form a complex with Sprouty2. Some of these (including the two main sites mentioned above) conform to the serine-containing consensus sites for phosphorylation by MNK1 kinase (K/R-X-X-S, R-X-S). It appears that serine phosphorylation is required to protect Sprouty2 from degradation.<br><br>In the absence of serine phosphorylation, phosphorylation of Tyr55 and subsequent binding to E3 ubiquitin ligase, CBL, is enhanced. Serine phosphorylation of Sprouty2 appears to stabilise the protein by interfering with its potential phosphorylation of Tyr55 (Sprouty2 appears to be a poor substrate for c-Src kinase) in response to growth factor stimulation.	p- MNK1;SPY2

2013	8	adds_modification	Phosphorylation of WDR77 (MEP50) on threonine-5 by cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4), as part of the complex cyclin D1: CDK4:PRMT5:WDR77 enhances PRMT5:WDR77 methyltransferase activity, which triggers events associated with cyclin D1-dependent neoplastic growth (Aggarwal et al. 2011). Cyclin D1 is an allosteric regulator of CDK4 and CDK6, mediating growth factor-dependent G1-phase progression. Growth factor stimulation induces cyclin D1 expression, its association with CDK4 and nuclear accumulation during mid-G1. Active cyclin D1:CDK4 catalyzes the phosphorylation-dependent inactivation of retinoblastoma (RB) family proteins (Diehl 2002, Gladden & Diehl 2005). Following the G1/S transition, cyclin D1 accumulation is opposed by phosphorylation of threonine-286 (T286) by glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3beta), which promotes cyclin D1 nuclear export (Alt et al. 2000).

2013	8	adds_modification	Tyrosine phosphorylation of PRMT5 can block WDR77 (MEP50) binding, which attenuates PRMT5 activity (Liu et al. 2011). The kinase JAK2 is constitutively activated by the mutation V617F, observed in most patients with non-chronic myelogenous leukemia (nCML) myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) (Liu et al. 2011). JAK2 V617F can phosphorylate STAT5 in the absence of upstream signals, which confers cytokine-independent growth to Ba/F3 cells and induces a myeloproliferative disease in mouse models (Akada et al. 2010, Marty et al., 2010, Mullally et al. 2010). JAK2 V617F phosphorylates PRMT5 predominantly at tyrosines 297, 304, and 307, significantly reducing the activity-enhancing interaction between PRMT5 and WDR77 (MEP50) (Liu et al. 2011).

2012	8	translocation	E-cadherin (CDH1) localizes to the lateral membrane of differentiated epithelia, providing the structural foundation for adherens junctions, multiprotein complexes that link cell-cell contacts to the actin cytoskeleton and various signaling molecules (Perez-Moreno et al. 2003, Baum & Georgiou 2011). The extracellular domain has five cadherin-type repeat ectodomain (EC) modules; the most membrane-distal EC mediates binding with CDH1 on adjacent cells (Boggon et al. 2002). Calcium ions bind between the EC domains of two CDH1 peptides to form a dimer with a rod-like conformation (Boggon et al. 2002) which is required for cell-cell interaction (Gumbiner 1996, Patel et al. 2006). The cytoplasmic tail of E-cadherin binds to the armadillo repeat protein beta-catenin, a target of the Wnt signaling pathway and a cofactor for TCF/LEF-mediated transcription (Gavard & Mège 2005). Beta-catenin in turn binds alpha-catenin, which interacts with the actin microfilament network, actin and the actin-binding proteins vinculin, formins, alpha-actinin, zonula occludin protein, and afadin (Bershadsky 2004). Cellcell adhesions also contain desmosomes, which link cell contacts to intermediate filaments, and nectin-based, calcium-independent adhesions, which are linked to actin (Takai & Nakanishi 2003, Yin and Green 2004). The critical importance of E-cadherin to normal development and tissue function is demonstrated by embryonic lethal E-cadherin gene mouse knockouts (Larue et al. 1994). Loss of cadherin-based cell-cell adhesion is a hallmark of carcinogenesis, correlating with tumour progression, allowing cells to escape normal growth control signals, resulting in loss of differentiation and increased cell proliferation associated with invasive behaviour (Frixen et al. 1991, Capaldo & Macara 2007). Full-length 120-kDa CDH1 protein is cleaved in the ectodomain close to the plasma membrane by a number of metalloproteases, generating an extracellular 38-kDa C-terminal fragment (CTF) termed CTF1 which can be further processed by a gamma-secretase-like activity to a soluble 33-kDa CTF2 (Marambaud et al. 2002, Roy & Berx 2008). MMP3, MMP7 (Noë et al. 2001, canine MMPs), MMP9 (Symowicz et al. 2007), plasmin (Ryniers et al. 2002, canine plasmin), Kallikrien 7 (Johnson et al. 2007), ADAM10 (Maretzky et al. 2005) and ADAM15 (Najy et al. 2008) all cleave CDH1 extracellularly, close to the transmembrane region. Presenilin-1 (Marambaud et al. 2002), the catalytic subunit of gamma-secretase (Herreman et al. 2003, Li et al. 2003), cleaves CDH1 producing a soluble 33-kDa fragment termed CTF2. Other enzymes like caspase-3 (Steinhusen et al. 2001) and calpain-1 (Rios-Doria et al. 2003) cleave E-cadherin in its cytoplasmic part releasing an intracellular 37 kDa C-terminal fragment.

Mutation of PHF8 phosphorylation sites impairs the dissociation of PHF8 from chromatin and the accumulation of H4K20me1 in prophase (Liu et al. 2010). Positions of CDK1-phosphorylated serine residues in PHF8, S33 and S84, are based on the sequence of PHF8 splicing isoform 2, which was used in the experiments of Liu et al. In PHF8 splicing isoforms 1 and 3, serine residues S69 and S120 are annotated as targets of CDK1-mediated phosphorylation.	p-T161-CDK1__CCNB1;H31T

2012	8	adds_modification	At the beginning of mitosis, MASTL (GWL, Greatwall kinase) is activated by phosphorylation at several key sites. Many of these sites, including functionally important threonine residues T194, T207 and T741 (corresponding to Xenopus residues T193, T206 and T748), are proline directed, matching CDK1 consensus sequence, and thus probably phosphorylated by CDK1, as shown by in vitro studies (Yu et al. 2006. Blake-Hodek et al. 2012). Phosphorylation of the serine residue S875 (S883 in Xenopus) is implicated as critical for the mitotic function of MASTL (Vigneron et al. 2011) and likely occurs through autophosphorylation (Blake-Hodek et al. 2012). Other kinases, such as PLK1 (Vigneron et al. 2011) and other MASTL phosphorylation sites may also be involved in mitotic activation of MASTL (Yu et al. 2006, Vigneron et al. 2011, Blake-Hodek et al. 2012). Phosphorylation of the serine residue S102 (S101 in Xenopus) is functionally important but the responsible kinase has not been identified (Blake-Hodek et al. 2012).	p-T161-CDK1__CCNB1;GWL

In vivo, phosphorylation of NCAPD3 threonine residue T1415 is blocked when cells are treated with CDK1 inhibitors. In addition, it was shown that CDK1 in complex with cyclin B1 (CDK1:CCNB1) phosphorylates NCAPD3 at T1415 in vitro (Abe et al. 2011).	p-T161-CDK1__CCNB1;CNDD3

2012	8	adds_modification	Multiple sites of phosphorylation are known to exist in SYK, which both regulate its activity and also serve as docking sites for other proteins. Some of these sites include Y131 of interdomain A, Y323, Y348, and Y352 of interdomain B, and Y525 and Y526 within the activation loop of the kinase domain and Y630 in the C-terminus (Zhang et al. 2002, Lupher et al. 1998, Furlong et al. 1997). Phosphorylation of these tyrosine residues disrupts autoinhibitory interactions and results in kinase activation even in the absence of phosphorylated ITAM tyrosines (Tsang et al. 2008). SYK is primarily phosphorylated by Src family kinases and this acts as an initiating trigger by generating few molecules of activated SYK which are then involved in major SYK autophosphorylation (Hillal et al. 1997).

The histone methyltransferase activity of EZH2 also trimethylates lysine-27 of histone H3 (H3K27me3). The promoters of the MYT, WNT1, KCNA1, and CNR1 genes are methylated on cytosine by the DNMT:PRC2 complex however not all loci that have H3K27me3 by PRC2 also have cytosine methylation (Vire et al. 2006, Brinkman et al. 2012). DNA methylation and H3K27me3 appear to be mutually exclusive in CpG islands but are compatible throughout most of the rest of the genome (Brinkman et al. 2012). In mouse, DNA methylation and H3K27me3 appear to be antagonistic at most loci: loss of DNA methylation causes increased H3K27me3 while loss of PRC2 has little effect on DNA methylation (Hagarman et al. 2013). By competing with DNMT3a,b for association with PRC2, DNMT3L may antagonize DNA methylation at sites bound by PRC2 (Neri et al. 2013).	DNMT1,3A,3B;H32

The 3-Hyp content of collagen is much more variable than that of 4-Hyp, varying between collagen types, tissues, developmental stages and pathological states (Kivirikko et al. 1992). It is more prevalent in type IV and V collagens at 10-15 3-Hyp residues (Bentz et al. 1983) than in Type I-III fibrillar collagens which have a single 3-Hyp residue per chain; the alpha-1 chain of type I collagen has 3-Hyp at residue 986 (Fietzek et al. 1972, Marini et al. 2007). 3-Hyp is formed from Pro in the Xaa position of Xaa-Hyp-Gly triplets (Gryder et al. 1975, Kivirikko et al. 1992). It is likely that 4-Hyp is a requirement at the second position of the triplet as 4-Hyp rich substrates are more active than 4-Hyp poor (Adams & Frank 1980). 3-Hyp has a modest effect on triple-helix stability (Jenkins et al. 2003; Mizuno et al. 2008). 3-Hyp may adjust the stability of basement membranes to enable formation of the meshwork structure, or serve as a ligand for other proteins.

Like P4H, P3H requires molecular oxygen, alpha-ketoglutarate, iron(II), and ascorbate for activity. P3H1 is homologous to mammalian leprecan or growth suppressor 1 (Gros1), and forms a 3-prolyl hydroxylation complex with cartilage-associated protein (CRTAP) and a peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase, cyclophilin B (CypB), which is encoded by the PPIB gene (Vranka et al. 2004).

It is more prevalent in type IV and V collagens at 10-15 3-Hyp residues (Bentz et al. 1983) than in Type I-III fibrillar collagens which have a single 3-Hyp residue per chain; the alpha-1 chain of type I collagen has 3-Hyp at residue 986 (Fietzek et al. 1972, Marini et al. 2007). 3-Hyp is formed from Pro in the Xaa position of Xaa-Hyp-Gly triplets (Gryder et al. 1975, Kivirikko et al. 1992). It is likely that 4-Hyp is a requirement at the second position of the triplet as 4-Hyp rich substrates are more active than 4-Hyp poor (Adams & Frank 1980). 3-Hyp has a modest effect on triple-helix stability (Jenkins et al. 2003; Mizuno et al. 2008). 3-Hyp may adjust the stability of basement membranes to enable formation of the meshwork structure, or serve as a ligand for other proteins. It is suggested to have a role in the self-assembly of collagen supramolecular structures (Weis et al. 2010). <br>3-Hyp is formed by prolyl 3-hydroxylase (P3H; EC 1.14.11.7), which has 3 isoforms in vertebrates. All contain an ER-retention signal but vary in their tissue expression (Vranka et al. 2009). P3H can hydroxylate prolines that precede 4-Hyp residues (Tryggvason et al. 1976) but not those that precede an unhydroxylated proline (Kivirikko & Myllla 1982, Myllyharju 2005). Like P4H, P3H requires molecular oxygen, alpha-ketoglutarate, iron(II), and ascorbate for activity. P3H1 is homologous to mammalian leprecan or growth suppressor 1 (Gros1), and forms a 3-prolyl hydroxylation complex with cartilage-associated protein (CRTAP) and a peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase, cyclophilin B (CypB), which is encoded by the PPIB gene (Vranka et al. 2004). Lack of 3-Hyp in Type I and II collagens leads to an osteogenesis imperfecta (OI)-like disease, as demonstrated by CRTAP and PPIB knock-out mice (Morello et al. 2006, Choi et al. 2009) and by mutations in human LEPRE1 (which encodes P3H1), CRTAP, and PPIB (Barnes et al. 2006, Cabral et al. 2007, van Dijk et al. 2009). The P3H1/CRTAP/CypB complex has also been shown to have chaperone activity (Ishikawa et al. 2009).

The 3-Hyp content of collagen is much more variable than that of 4-Hyp, varying between collagen types, tissues, developmental stages and pathological states (Kivirikko et al. 1992). It is more prevalent in type IV and V collagens at 10-15 3-Hyp residues (Bentz et al. 1983) than in Type I-III fibrillar collagens which have a single 3-Hyp residue per chain; the alpha-1 chain of type I collagen has 3-Hyp at residue 986 (Fietzek et al. 1972, Marini et al. 2007). 3-Hyp is formed from Pro in the Xaa position of Xaa-Hyp-Gly triplets (Gryder et al. 1975, Kivirikko et al. 1992). It is likely that 4-Hyp is a requirement at the second position of the triplet as 4-Hyp rich substrates are more active than 4-Hyp poor (Adams & Frank 1980). 3-Hyp has a modest effect on triple-helix stability (Jenkins et al. 2003; Mizuno et al. 2008). 3-Hyp may adjust the stability of basement membranes to enable formation of the meshwork structure, or serve as a ligand for other proteins.

All contain an ER-retention signal but vary in their tissue expression (Vranka et al. 2009). P3H can hydroxylate prolines that precede 4-Hyp residues (Tryggvason et al. 1976) but not those that precede an unhydroxylated proline (Kivirikko & Myllla 1982, Myllyharju 2005). Like P4H, P3H requires molecular oxygen, alpha-ketoglutarate, iron(II), and ascorbate for activity. P3H1 is homologous to mammalian leprecan or growth suppressor 1 (Gros1), and forms a 3-prolyl hydroxylation complex with cartilage-associated protein (CRTAP) and a peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase, cyclophilin B (CypB), which is encoded by the PPIB gene (Vranka et al. 2004). Lack of 3-Hyp in Type I and II collagens leads to an osteogenesis imperfecta (OI)-like disease, as demonstrated by CRTAP and PPIB knock-out mice (Morello et al. 2006, Choi et al. 2009) and by mutations in human LEPRE1 (which encodes P3H1), CRTAP, and PPIB (Barnes et al. 2006, Cabral et al. 2007, van Dijk et al. 2009).

Lack of 3-Hyp in Type I and II collagens leads to an osteogenesis imperfecta (OI)-like disease, as demonstrated by CRTAP and PPIB knock-out mice (Morello et al. 2006, Choi et al. 2009) and by mutations in human LEPRE1 (which encodes P3H1), CRTAP, and PPIB (Barnes et al. 2006, Cabral et al. 2007, van Dijk et al. 2009). The P3H1/CRTAP/CypB complex has also been shown to have chaperone activity (Ishikawa et al. 2009).

The 3-Hyp content of collagen is much more variable than that of 4-Hyp, varying between collagen types, tissues, developmental stages and pathological states (Kivirikko et al. 1992). It is more prevalent in type IV and V collagens at 10-15 3-Hyp residues (Bentz et al. 1983) than in Type I-III fibrillar collagens which have a single 3-Hyp residue per chain; the alpha-1 chain of type I collagen has 3-Hyp at residue 986 (Fietzek et al. 1972, Marini et al. 2007). 3-Hyp is formed from Pro in the Xaa position of Xaa-Hyp-Gly triplets (Gryder et al. 1975, Kivirikko et al. 1992). It is likely that 4-Hyp is a requirement at the second position of the triplet as 4-Hyp rich substrates are more active than 4-Hyp poor (Adams & Frank 1980). 3-Hyp has a modest effect on triple-helix stability (Jenkins et al. 2003; Mizuno et al. 2008). 3-Hyp may adjust the stability of basement membranes to enable formation of the meshwork structure, or serve as a ligand for other proteins.

P3H can hydroxylate prolines that precede 4-Hyp residues (Tryggvason et al. 1976) but not those that precede an unhydroxylated proline (Kivirikko & Myllla 1982, Myllyharju 2005). Like P4H, P3H requires molecular oxygen, alpha-ketoglutarate, iron(II), and ascorbate for activity. P3H1 is homologous to mammalian leprecan or growth suppressor 1 (Gros1), and forms a 3-prolyl hydroxylation complex with cartilage-associated protein (CRTAP) and a peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase, cyclophilin B (CypB), which is encoded by the PPIB gene (Vranka et al. 2004). Lack of 3-Hyp in Type I and II collagens leads to an osteogenesis imperfecta (OI)-like disease, as demonstrated by CRTAP and PPIB knock-out mice (Morello et al. 2006, Choi et al. 2009) and by mutations in human LEPRE1 (which encodes P3H1), CRTAP, and PPIB (Barnes et al. 2006, Cabral et al. 2007, van Dijk et al. 2009). The P3H1/CRTAP/CypB complex has also been shown to have chaperone activity (Ishikawa et al. 2009).

The 3-Hyp content of collagen is much more variable than that of 4-Hyp, varying between collagen types, tissues, developmental stages and pathological states (Kivirikko et al. 1992). It is more prevalent in type IV and V collagens at 10-15 3-Hyp residues (Bentz et al. 1983) than in Type I-III fibrillar collagens which have a single 3-Hyp residue per chain; the alpha-1 chain of type I collagen has 3-Hyp at residue 986 (Fietzek et al. 1972, Marini et al. 2007). 3-Hyp is formed from Pro in the Xaa position of Xaa-Hyp-Gly triplets (Gryder et al. 1975, Kivirikko et al. 1992). It is likely that 4-Hyp is a requirement at the second position of the triplet as 4-Hyp rich substrates are more active than 4-Hyp poor (Adams & Frank 1980). 3-Hyp has a modest effect on triple-helix stability (Jenkins et al. 2003; Mizuno et al. 2008). 3-Hyp may adjust the stability of basement membranes to enable formation of the meshwork structure, or serve as a ligand for other proteins.

It is likely that 4-Hyp is a requirement at the second position of the triplet as 4-Hyp rich substrates are more active than 4-Hyp poor (Adams & Frank 1980). 3-Hyp has a modest effect on triple-helix stability (Jenkins et al. 2003; Mizuno et al. 2008). 3-Hyp may adjust the stability of basement membranes to enable formation of the meshwork structure, or serve as a ligand for other proteins. It is suggested to have a role in the self-assembly of collagen supramolecular structures (Weis et al. 2010). <br>3-Hyp is formed by prolyl 3-hydroxylase (P3H; EC 1.14.11.7), which has 3 isoforms in vertebrates. All contain an ER-retention signal but vary in their tissue expression (Vranka et al. 2009). P3H can hydroxylate prolines that precede 4-Hyp residues (Tryggvason et al. 1976) but not those that precede an unhydroxylated proline (Kivirikko & Myllla 1982, Myllyharju 2005). Like P4H, P3H requires molecular oxygen, alpha-ketoglutarate, iron(II), and ascorbate for activity. P3H1 is homologous to mammalian leprecan or growth suppressor 1 (Gros1), and forms a 3-prolyl hydroxylation complex with cartilage-associated protein (CRTAP) and a peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase, cyclophilin B (CypB), which is encoded by the PPIB gene (Vranka et al. 2004). Lack of 3-Hyp in Type I and II collagens leads to an osteogenesis imperfecta (OI)-like disease, as demonstrated by CRTAP and PPIB knock-out mice (Morello et al. 2006, Choi et al. 2009) and by mutations in human LEPRE1 (which encodes P3H1), CRTAP, and PPIB (Barnes et al. 2006, Cabral et al. 2007, van Dijk et al. 2009). The P3H1/CRTAP/CypB complex has also been shown to have chaperone activity (Ishikawa et al. 2009).

2007	8	adds_modification	The intrinsic protein tyrosine kinase activity of activated FGF receptor 3 catalyzes multiple phosphorylation events, creating a number of binding sites on its cytoplasmic tail for membrane bound docking proteins to gather intracellular signaling mediators. Based on sequence alignment, FGFR3 contains 6 of the 8 cytoplasmic tyrosine residues identified in FGFR1. Mutagenesis studies highlight the importance of tyrosine residue 724 in signaling mediated by FGFR3, including transformation, SHP2 phosphorylation, and activation of MAPK, PI3K and STAT pathways. These studies also identified a role for the PLCgamma-binding tyrosine residue, Y760, in STAT activation, and a potential role for tyrosine 770 as a negative regulator of FGFR3 signaling.

2004	8	adds_modification	Cdk-9 is the kinase subunit of P-TEFb that phosphorylates Serine 2 on the heptapeptide repeats of Pol II CTD alleviating the negative action of DSIF-NELF complex. This reaction is considered to be a rate limiting step for processive elongation. P-TEFb complex, that has a DRB-sensitive cyclin-dependent kinase activity, is composed of ~43 kDa, Cdk9 kinase (PITALRE), and either Cyclin T1, Cyclin T2a, Cyclin T2b, or Cyclin K. The exact mechanism by which P-TEFb removes the inhibition of elongation by DSIF-NELF is not yet known. P-TEFb is also capable of phosphorylating Spt5 subunit of DSIF complex. <BR> A P-TEFb complex (which contains only the Cyclin T1) is implicated in the efficient synthesis of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) transcripts. Cyclin T1 subunit of the P-TEFb(Cyclin T1:Cdk9) complex interacts with HIV-1 encoded Tat protein that binds to the transactivation response (TAR) element in the nascent HIV-1 transcript (reviewed in Price,2000). <BR>The mechanism by which DSIF, NELF and P-TEFb or TAK/P-TEFb act together in Pol II-regulated elongation is yet to be fully understood. Various biochemical evidences point to a model in which DSIF and NELF negatively regulate elongation through interactions with polymerase containing a hypophosphorylated CTD. Subsequent phosphorylation of the Pol II CTD by P-TEFb might promote elongation by inhibiting interactions of DSIF and NELF with the elongation complex.<BR>	CCNT1__CCNT2__CDK9;RPB1

Moreover, inactive HSF1 was reported to constitutively shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm in mammalian cells (Vujanac M et al. 2005). However, active HSF1 trimers were shown to rapidly accumulate in the nucleus where they bind to heat shock elements (HSE) present within promoters of hsp genes (Wang Y and Morgan WD 1994; Herbomel G et al. 2013).<p>Heat shock response in human and monkey cells (but not rodent cells) is also associated with the stress-induced relocalization of HSF1 within the nucleus not only on hsp gene promoters but also into specific subnuclear organelles termed nuclear stress bodies (nSBs, also known as HSF1 granules) (Sarge KD et a. 1993; Cotto JJ et al. 1997; Jolly C et al. 1999). nSBs are rarely detectable in unstressed cells but their number drastically increases after heat shock. Formation of nSBs is initiated by the interaction between HSF1 and pericentric tandem repeats of satellite III sequences on chromosome 9, where sat III repeats are transcribed by RNA polymerase II in an HSF1-dependent manner. (Jolly C et al. 2002, 2004). HSF1 can also bind to DNA regions enriched in sat II and sat III repeated sequences detected on other human chromosomes (Eymery A et al. 2010). The functional relevance of HSF1 granules and their transcripts remains an open question.	YWHAE;HSF1

2013	8	adds_modification	P130CAS (CRK-associated substrate/BCAR1) contains multiple protein-protein interaction domains including an N-terminal SH3 domain, an interior substrate domain (SD), a Src-binding domain (SBD) near the C-terminus and a conserved C-terminal Cas-family homology (CCH) domain. The SH3 and CCH domains mediate localization to focal adhesions (FAs) while SD and SBD are involved in initiating signaling events (Meenderink et al. 2010, Shin et al. 2004). The p130CAS SD undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation and mediates signals by recruiting downstream effectors. The SD is characterised by fifteen YxxP motifs, of which ten can be efficiently phosphorylated by Src family kinases (SFKs) (Shin et al. 2004). FAK kinase phosphorylates the nearby SBD tyrosines 664 and 666 (mouse 668/670). These SBD tyrosines provide the additional binding sites for Src-SH2 domains, stabilizing the SRC-p130CAS association (Ruest et al. 2001).

Two threonine residues at positions 1400 and 1412 (analogous to 1381 and 1393 in mouse) in the activation loop of MEKK1 between the kinase subdomains VII and VIII are essential for its catalytic activity. The catalytic domain of MEKK1 is able to autophosphorylate these residues, enhancing its own activity.	MEKK1;M3K1
2014	8	adds_modification	Although direct phosphorylation of GLI1 by PKA has not been demonstrated, deletion of the putative PKA sites abrogates the interaction of GLI1 with beta-TrCP and stabilizes GLI1 protein levels; similarly, treatment of GLI1-expressing cells with PKA inhibitors delays the kinetics of GLI1 degradation (Huntzicker et al, 2006). These data are consistent with a role for PKA-mediated phosphorylation in promoting the proteasome-dependent degradation of GLI1 in the absence of Hh signal, as is the case for GLI2 and GLI3 (Huntzicker et al, 2006; Tempe et al, 2006; Pan and Wang, 2007; Pan et al, 2009). Potential roles for CK2 and GSK3 in promoting the phosphorylation-dependent degradation of GLI1 have not been investigated.	PRKACG__PRKACA__PRKACB;GLI1

Ubiquitinated TRAF6 trimer, acts as a E3 ligase and induces this ubiquitination. The ubiquitin target sites in NEMO are not yet clearly identified. Studies of different NF-kB signaling pathways revealed several potential ubiquitination sites on NEMO (e.g., K285, K277, K309 and K399) (Fuminori et al. 2009).	K63polyUb TRAF6;NEMO

Phosphorylation of this site is critical for the PKC theta kinase activity, and its ability to activate NF-kB pathway. PKC theta is later trans-autophopshorylated on putative phosphorylation sites (S676, S695) for the fine-tuning of its kinase activity.	PIP3, PI(3,4)P2__PDK1;KPCT

BRCA1 plays an important role in the response to double-strand breaks, participating in genome surveillance, DNA repair, and cell cycle checkpoint arrests. BRCA1 is required for ATM-dependent phosphorylation of NBS1 following exposure to ionizing radiation (Foray et al., 2003). BRCA1 also interacts with the MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 complex which has been implicated early in HRR during resection of the double-strand break.	p-S1981-ATM;BRCA1

2014	8	removes_modification	CTDNEP1:CNEP1R1 serine/threonine protein phosphatase complex consists of the catalytic subunit CTDNEP1 (Dullard) and the regulatory subunit CNEP1R1 (TMEM188) and is evolutionarily conserved from yeast to mammals (Kim et al. 2007, Han et al. 2012). CTDNEP1:CNEP1R1 and its yeast counterpart NEM1:SPO7 localize to the nuclear envelope and the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. CTDNEP1:CNEP1R1 dephosphorylates lipins (LPIN1, LPIN2 and LPIN3), which act as phosphatidate phosphatases, dephosphorylating phosphatidate (PA) and converting it to diacylglycerol (DAG). The yeast NEM1:SPO7 complex dephosphorylates yeast lipin orthologue PAH1 (SMP2, PAP1). CTDNEP1:CNEP1R1 shows a preference for the phosphorylated serine S106 of lipins. S106 phosphorylation is insulin-induced, and could be mediated by CDK1, as it is proline-directed (Wu et al. 2011). CDC28, a yeast homolog of CDK1, was shown to phosphorylate PAH1, while NEM1:SPO7 removes CDC28-introduced phosphate groups. Lipin phosphorylation regulates lipin localization, with phosphorylated lipins being soluble and dephosphorylated lipins being membrane-bound (Grimsey et al. 2008, Choi et al. 2011). The association of lipins with the nuclear envelope brings lipins in proximity to its substrate, PA, thereby enabling lipin catalytic activity (Karanasios et al. 2010). Catalytic activity of PAH1 regulates the morphology and dynamics of endoplasmic reticulum and nuclear membranes in yeast. In C. elegans and in human cell lines, lipin catalytic activity is needed for mitotic progression as it facilitates depolymerization of the nuclear lamina and nuclear envelope breakdown (Santos-Rosa et al. 2005, Kim et al. 2007, Gorjanacz et al. 2009, Golden et al. 2009, Choi et al. 2011, Mall et al. 2012).

Phosphorylation occurs on serine and threonine residues in 2 clusters and appears to be primed by phosphorylation at S5, S82 and S84. VANGL2 phosphorylation and activation occurs in a graded fashion in response to WNT5A distribution, helping to establish PCP asymmetry (Gao et al, 2011).	unknown kinase;VANG2

2010	8	adds_modification	GH has short term effects that mimic the actions of insulin in tissues that have been deprived of GH, including increased amino acid transport, glucose transport, and lipogenesis (Davidson 1987). GH and insulin have overlapping signaling pathways (Dominici et al. 2005). GH stimulates tyrosyl phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) (Souza et al. 1994, Thirone et al. 1999), and IRS-2 (Argetsinger et al. 1996, Thirone et al. 1999), although more modestly than insulin or IGF-1. Tyrosyl phosphorylation of IRS-1 and IRS-2 in response to insulin provides binding sites for specific proteins containing SH2 domains, including the 85-kDa regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), tyrosine phosphatase SHP2, and Grb2. This is one of several mechanisms proposed to explain the stimulatory effect of GH on the PI3-kinase/Akt pathway (Jin et al. 2008). GH promotes the binding of the 85-kDa regulatory subunit of PI3K to IRS-1 and IRS-2 in cultured cells (Ridderstrale et al. 1995, Argetsinger et al. 1995, 1996). Studies using truncated or mutated GHRs suggest that tyrosyl phosphorylation of IRS-1, IRS-2, and Shc is dependent on JAK2 activation (Argetsinger et al. 1995, 1996, VanderKuur et al. 1995). Despite a strong correlation between JAK2 activation and IRS phosphorylation it is not clear whether there is a direct association. JAK2 has been reported to interact directly with IRS in response to angiotensin II (Velloso et al. 1996) but also reported to interact indirectly via SH2B in response to leptin (Duan et al.2004).

BRCA1 is required for ATM-dependent phosphorylation of NBS1 following exposure to ionizing radiation (Foray et al., 2003).

2010	8	adds_modification	Cbl is tyrosine phosphorylated following stimulation with IL-3 (Anderson et al. 1997) and GM-CSF (Odai et al. 1995). Cbl may be phosphorylated prior to this IL-3 stimulated tyrosyl phosphorylation (Park et al. 1998). The kinase responsible for Cbl phosphorylation may be dependent on cell type; Fyn is demonstrated to have the ability to phosphorylate Cbl (Hunter et al. 1999), other candidates include Hck, Lyn (Hunter et al. 1999) and Syk (Park et al. 1998).<br><br> Tyrosines 700, 731 and 774 are the major sites of Cbl phosphorylation by non-receptor protein tyrosine kinases, with none showing any particular specificity for sites (Tsygankov et al. 2001). Fyn was observed to be constitutively associated with Cbl in lysates of several different cell types including the interleukin-3-dependent murine myeloid cell line 32Dcl3, and the prolactin-dependent rat thymoma cell line Nb2. Cbl phosphorylation at Y731 is postulated to provide an additional interaction between Cbl and the SH2 domain of p85-PI3K (Hunter et al. 1999). Cbl-p85 association increases in activated cells (Panchamoorthy et al. 1996). Expression of a Cbl Y731F mutant which abolishes binding of Cbl to p85 markedly increased levels of p85-PI3K (Dufour et al. 2008). Cbl-p85 binding negatively regulates PI3K activity (Fang et al. 2001); Cbl phosphorylation increased PI3K ubiquitination and proteasome degradation (Dufour et al. 2008). Cbl association with members of the Crk family is mediated by phosphorylation of Y700 and Y774 (Andoniou et al. 1996), binding with Vav is mediated by Y770 (Marengere et al 1997).

2007	8	translocation	Alpha5beta1 integrin was the first integrin shown to bind fibronectin (FN1). Unlike other FN1-binding integrins it is a specialist at this task. In solution FN1 occurs as a dimer. Binding to alpha5beta1 integrin stimulates FN1 self-association; blocking the RGD-cell binding domain of FN1 blocks fibril formation (Fogerty et al. 1990). FN1 binding is believed to induce integrin clustering, which promotes FN1-FN1 interactions. Integrin clustering is mediated by association between integrins and intracellular actin stress fibers (Calderwood et al. 2000). Binding of integrins to each of the monomers in the FN1 dimer pair is thought to trigger a conformational change in FN1 that exposes 'cryptic' FN1 binding sites that allow additional fibronectin dimers to bind without the requirement for pre-association with integrins (Singh et al. 2010). This non-covalent interaction may involve interactions with fibrillin (Ohashi & Erickson 2009). I1-5 functions as a unit that is the primary FN matrix assembly domain (Sottile et al. 1991) but other units are likely to be involved (Singh et al. 2010). Other integrins able to bind FN1 include alphaIIbBeta3, which is highly expressed on platelets where it predominantly binds fibrinogen leading to thrombus formation but also binds FN1 (Savage et al. 1996). Alpha4beta1 mediates cell-cell contacts and cell-matrix contacts through the ligands VCAM-1 and FN1, respectively (Humphries et al. 1995). Integrins alpha3beta1, alpha4beta7, alphaVbeta1, 3 (Johansson et al. 1997), 6 (Busk et al. 1992) and alpha8beta1 (Muller et al. 1995, Farias et al. 2005) are all able to bind FN1. <br><br>Tenacious binding of free fibronectin to cells leads to enhanced fibronectin matrix assembly and the formation of a polymerized fibronectin "cocoon" around the cells. This process is enhanced in the presence of CEACAM molecules.	Neutrophil CEACAMs affecting integrin binding to fibronectin;FINC

2006	8	translocation	BAMBI (BMP and activin membrane-bound inhibitor) is a transmembrane protein closely related to TGF-beta family receptors type I, but without serine/threonine kinase activity. In Xenopus, BAMBI expression is regulated by BMP4. BAMBI interferes with BMP, activin and TGF-beta receptor complex signaling. BAMBI binds various TGF-beta type I receptors, showing the highest affinity for TGFBR1. BAMBI can also bind TGFBR2 and activin receptor type II (Onichtchouk et al. 1999). BAMBI binds SMAD7, and this interaction involves MH1 and MH2 domains of SMAD7 and the intracellular domain of BAMBI. BAMBI and SMAD7 cooperate in the repression of TGF-beta receptor complex signaling, but BAMBI-mediated recruitment of SMAD7 to activated TGF-beta receptor complex, as BAMBI preferentially binds activated TGFBR1, does not lead to TGFBR1 degradation (Yan et al. 2009). BAMBI may downregulate TGF-beta receptor complex signaling by replacing one TGFBR1 molecule in the TGF-beta receptor heterotetramer (Onichtchouk et al. 1999). Alternatively, BAMBI-mediated recruitment of SMAD7 may compete with binding of SMAD2 and SMAD3 (R-SMADs) to the activated TGF-beta receptor complex, thus interfering with the activation of R-SMADs (Yan et al. 2009).

2013	8	adds_modification	The transcriptional activity of HSF1 has been shown to be controlled by the regulatory domain composed of amino acids 221-310 (Green M et al. 1995; Zuo J et al. 1995; Newton EM et al., 1996). Ser230 is located in this regulatory domain of HSF1 and is constitutively and stress-inducibly phosphorylated (Holmberg CI et al. 2001). Analyses with phosphopeptide-specific antibody and site-directed mutagenesis revealed that phosphorylation at Ser230 enhanced the inducible HSF1 transcriptional activity in heat-shocked human K562 erythroleukemia and HeLa cells (Holmberg CI et al 2001). Active calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) was shown to phosphorylate HSF1 at Ser230 in vitro. Moreover, CaMKII enhanced heat-induced tranactivating capacity of HSF1 and the level of endogenous Ser230 phosphorylation in K562 cells transfected with active CaMKII together with a CAT reporter plasmid containing the proximal HSE of human hsp70 promoter. Thus, CaMKII signaling may be involved in the positive regulation of HSF1-mediated transactivation. However, the possibility that other protein kinases might also phosphorylate Ser230 in vivo should not be excluded (Holmberg CI et al 2001).

Once inside, CRs containing all-trans-retinyl esters (atREs) can be directly and rapidly taken up by liver parenchymal cells via the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) using apolipoprotein E (apoE) as a ligand. Internalization of remnants occur via endocytosis (see review D'Ambrosio et al. 2011). This reaction is inferred from uptake studies in mice (Yu et al. 2000). Defects in LDLR cause familial hypercholesterolemia (FH, MIM:143890), a common autosomal disease that affects about 1 in 500 people in most countries. Abnormal LDLR doesn't remove LDL from circulation resulting in high levels of LDL in blood, leading to early cardiovascular disease via atherosclerosis.

In humans almost all circulating GLP-1 is GLP-1 (7-36) amidated at the C-terminus. Experiments in knockout mice have shown that PC1 is necessary for cleavage. Carboxypeptidase E and peptidylglycine alpha-amidating monooxygenase may be involved in trimming and amidating the C-terminus.	PCSK1__Ca2+;GLUC
2008	8	adds_modification	Cystine bonds are formed in Proinsulin-1 between cysteine residues 31 and 96, cysteine residues 43 and 109, and cysteine residues 95 and 100. Ero1-like alpha does not directly catalyze the oxidation of cysteines to cystine. Instead it maintains a suitably oxidizing environment for the reactions to occur . Though Ero1-like alpha can act via specific isomerases such as P4HB/PDI, there is currently no evidence that formation of cystine bonds in insulin requires a specific isomerase. Interestingly, even in beta cells of wild type animals, trace amounts of incorrectly bonded proinsulin can be detected. Thus, the formation of correct cystine bonds may involve a period of bond shuffling.	ERO1L__ERO1LB;INS

PLC hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol (PIP2) to diacyl glycerol (DAG) and inositol triphosphate (IP3). DAG acts as a second messenger that activates protein kinase C (PKC) and IP3 can bind to IP3 receptors, particular calcium channels in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Calcium flow causes the cytosolic concentration of calcium to increase, causing a cascade of intracellular changes and activity.	Ligand:GPCR complexes that activate Gq/11;GHRL

2006	8	translocation	Within early endosomes, p75NTR C-Terminal Fragment undergoes processing by gamma-secretase, a complex composed of a presenilin homodimer (PSEN1 or PSEN2), nicastrin (NCSTN), APH1 (APH1A or APH1B) and PEN2. Such a minimal complex is sufficient for secretase activity, although other components may exist. The p75NTR cleavage by gamma-secretase gives rise to a 20-kD ICD (IntraCellular Domain) fragment, and to a small peptide, the significance of which is unknown but that is analogous to the A-beta peptides generated from amyloid precursor protein. p75NTR ICD may have cytoplasmic and nuclear signalling functions and it is unstable.

2007	8	translocation	The viral polymerase complex produces positive-sense viral mRNA with host-cell derived 5' methyl caps. Capped viral mRNAs are selectively exported from the host cell nucleus through a currently unclear mechanism that may rely on components of the host cell mRNA export machinery (Chen, 2000; Engelhardt, 2006).

2013	8	adds_modification	NHLRC1 (malin) associates with the glycogen particle where it functions as a ubiquitin E3 ligase to mediate the polyubiquitination of EPM2A (laforin) and PPP1R3C (PTG). The two polyubiquitinated proteins are targeted for proteasome-mediated degradation, leaving a glycogen-GYG1 particle associated with GYS1 (Gentry et al. 2005, Worby et al. 2008). In NHLRC1 knockout mice, PPP1R3C levels are unchanged, rather than increased, suggesting that NHLRC1 does not target PPP1R3C for degradation. However, EPM2A protein levels are increased in this knockout consistent with NHLRC1s proposed role. (DePaoli-Roach et al. 2010).	malin;EPM2A

2013	8	adds_modification	Six tyrosine phosphorylation sites in focal adhesion kinase 1 (FAK1) serve to modulate FAK1 kinase activity or mediate FAK1 interaction with SH2-domain containing proteins. These are Y397, Y407, Y576, Y577, Y861 and Y925 (Mitra et al. 2005). They are differentially phosphorylated by diverse agonists and implicated in transmitting different signals and effects (Ciccimaro et al. 2006, Le Boeuf et al. 2004,2006). Y397 is the major autophosphorylation site present upstream of the FAK kinase domain (Schaller et al. 1994). In response to VEGF stimulation FAK1 is recruited and autophosphorylated at Y397. This phosphorylated tyrosine then creates a binding site for other signaling proteins that link FAK1 to downstream signaling pathways and the actin cytoskeleton (Toutant et al. 2002).	FAK;FAK1

Identification of the sheddases for EGFR ligands using mouse embryonic cells lacking candidate sheddases (a disintegrin and metalloprotease; ADAM) has revealed that ADAM10, -12 and -17 are the sheddases of the EGFR ligands in response to various shedding stimulants such as GPCR agonists, growth factors, cytokines, osmotic stress, wounding and phorbol ester. Among the EGFR ligands, heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF), EGF and TGF-alpha are the best characterized.	ADAM metalloprotease__Zn2+;EGF

2003	8	removes_modification	With insulin dissociated from its receptor the signal to sustain the receptor kinase's activity is also removed. Thus endosomally-associated protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) are able to dephosphorylate the receptor which now can not rephosphorylate themselves since insulin is removed and the receptor is in the inactive protein conformation. (The identity of these PTPs is not clearly established yet. A discussion of candidates will be added in the near future.)<p>The dephosphorylation of the receptor is also a signal for the receptor to recycle back to the plasma membrane.	protein tyrosine phosphatase;INSR

2012	8	translocation	TRAF3 is a ubiquitin ligase recruited to both MYD88- and TRIF-assembled signalling complexes [Hacker H et al 2006]. However, TRAF3 controls the production of interferon and proinflammatory cytokines in different ways [Tseng PH et al 2010]. Positive or negative type of regulation is dictated by TRAF3 subcellular distribution and its mode of ubiquitination. Thus, TRIF-mediated signaling initiated on endosomes triggers TRAF3 self-ubiquitination through noncanonical (K63-linked) polyubiquitination, which is essential for activation of IRF3/7 and the interferon response. In contrast, during MyD88-dependent signaling initiated from plasma membrane TRAF3 functions as a negative regulator of inflammatory cytokines and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), unless it undergoes degradative (K48-linked) polyubiquitination mediated by TRAF6 and a pair of the ubiquitin ligases cIAP1 and cIAP2.

2012	8	translocation	Rac1 exists in inactive state in the cytosol until the reception of extracellular signals by the cell. To be functional Rac1 is rapidly targeted to the plasma membrane upon cell stimulation. The main factors involved in this mobilisation are the Rac GEFs like VAV and phospholipids (PtdIns(4,5)P2, PtdIns(3,4,5) P3) and lipid rafts at the plasma membrane. VAV catalyses the disassociation of GDP from Rac1 by modifying the nucleotide-binding site such that GDP is released and subsequently replaced. The incoming GTP occupies the nucleotide binding site and finally displaces VAV from Rac1 (Bos et al. 2007, Bustelo et al. 2012).	PIP3__p-VAV family;RAC1

CFL1 is a member of the ADF (actin-depolymerizing factor) protein family that is involved in regulating actin dynamics in the growth cone. It binds to actin in a one-to-one molar ratio, and stimulates both the severing of actin filaments and depolymerization of actin subunits from the actin filament end. Activated LIMK phosphorylates CFL1 on the conserved serine 3 residue located near the actin-binding site. After phosphorylation, CFL1 is inactive, loses its affinity for actin and dissociates from G-actin monomers. Once freed, ADP-actin monomers can exchange ADP with cytoplasmic ATP, ready for reincorporation at the barbed end of a growing filament (Gungabissoon & Bamburg 2003).	LIMK1__Sema3a__Nrp1__PLXNA1;Cfl1

In yeast, the VCP homologue Cdc48 is associated with two additional proteins Ufd1 and Npl4 -both of which are also conserved in mammals- and this complex interacts with several ER components including derlins and the yeast SYVN1 homologue, Hrd1 (reviewed in Vembar and Brodsky, 2009). Consistent with the yeast data, VCP interacts with DERL2 by co-immunoprecipitation in HEK293 cells (Huang et al, 2013).	ub C-terminal Hh fragments__OS9/ERLEC1;SHH

Gt is a heterotrimer of alpha1 (GNAT1) (van Dop et al. 1989, Fong 1992), beta1 (GNB1) (Codina et al. 1986) and gamma1 (GNGT1) (Tao et al. 1993) subunits. Photoactivated rhodopsin (MII or R*) catalyzes the exchange of GTP for GDP bound to Gt. Upon GTP/GDP exchange, Gt is released from MII and the Gt alpha with GTP bound (GNAT1 GTP) dissociates from Gt beta gamma subunits (GNB1:GNGT1). This mechanism was deciphered from bovine experiments (Pugh & Lamb 1993). MII proceeds to activate additional Gt molecules, making this reaction the first amplification step in the phototransduction cascade. A single activated rhodopsin molecule activates tens of Gt molecules. Although phosphorylation of activated rhodopsin (MII) by rhodopsin kinase (GRK1) reduces transducin activation (Khani et al. 1996), complete deactivation occurs only after arrestin (S-antigen or SAG, Yamaki et al. 1988) binds to and sterically caps MII.<br><br>Defects in GNAT1 cause the Nougaret type of autosomal dominant, congenital stationary night blindness (Dryja et al. 1996, CSNBAD3; MIM:610444) .

2012	8	translocation	E-cadherin (CDH1) localizes to the lateral membrane of differentiated epithelia, providing the structural foundation for adherens junctions, multiprotein complexes that link cell-cell contacts to the actin cytoskeleton and various signaling molecules (Perez-Moreno et al. 2003, Baum & Georgiou 2011). The extracellular domain has five cadherin-type repeat ectodomain (EC) modules; the most membrane-distal EC mediates binding with CDH1 on adjacent cells (Boggon et al. 2002). Calcium ions bind between the EC domains of two CDH1 peptides to form a dimer with a rod-like conformation (Boggon et al. 2002) which is required for cell-cell interaction (Gumbiner 1996, Patel et al. 2006). The cytoplasmic tail of E-cadherin binds to the armadillo repeat protein beta-catenin, a target of the Wnt signaling pathway and a cofactor for TCF/LEF-mediated transcription (Gavard & Mège 2005). Beta-catenin in turn binds alpha-catenin, which interacts with the actin microfilament network, actin and the actin-binding proteins vinculin, formins, alpha-actinin, zonula occludin protein, and afadin (Bershadsky 2004). Cellcell adhesions also contain desmosomes, which link cell contacts to intermediate filaments, and nectin-based, calcium-independent adhesions, which are linked to actin (Takai & Nakanishi 2003, Yin and Green 2004). The critical importance of E-cadherin to normal development and tissue function is demonstrated by embryonic lethal E-cadherin gene mouse knockouts (Larue et al. 1994). Loss of cadherin-based cell-cell adhesion is a hallmark of carcinogenesis, correlating with tumour progression, allowing cells to escape normal growth control signals, resulting in loss of differentiation and increased cell proliferation associated with invasive behaviour (Frixen et al. 1991, Capaldo & Macara 2007). Full-length 120-kDa CDH1 protein is cleaved in the ectodomain close to the plasma membrane by a number of metalloproteases, generating an extracellular 38-kDa C-terminal fragment (CTF) termed CTF1 which can be further processed by a gamma-secretase-like activity to a soluble 33-kDa CTF2 (Marambaud et al. 2002, Roy & Berx 2008). MMP3, MMP7 (Noë et al. 2001, canine MMPs), MMP9 (Symowicz et al. 2007), plasmin (Ryniers et al. 2002, canine plasmin), Kallikrien 7 (Johnson et al. 2007), ADAM10 (Maretzky et al. 2005) and ADAM15 (Najy et al. 2008) all cleave CDH1 extracellularly, close to the transmembrane region. Presenilin-1 (Marambaud et al. 2002), the catalytic subunit of gamma-secretase (Herreman et al. 2003, Li et al. 2003), cleaves CDH1 producing a soluble 33-kDa fragment termed CTF2. Other enzymes like caspase-3 (Steinhusen et al. 2001) and calpain-1 (Rios-Doria et al. 2003) cleave E-cadherin in its cytoplasmic part releasing an intracellular 37 kDa c-terminal fragment.

Since Plx1-dependent Cdc25C phosphorylation occurs in the absence of Cdc2 activity, it is likely that Plx1 is a triggering kinase, which leads to the activation of Cdc2 and therefore the normal onset of mitosis. In addition to catalytically activating CDC25C, PLK1-mediated phosphorylation also results in the nuclear accumulation of CDC25C (Toyoshima-Morimoto et al. 2002).	PLK1;MPIP3

A Ca2+ dependent opsin phosphatase is also present (Kutuzov & Bennett 1996). Serine/threonine protein phosphatases with EF hands (PPEF1 and 2) that share homology with Drosophila retinal degeneration C (rdgC) are expressed in retina and may be responsible (Huang & Honkanen 1998), there is no evidence for a physiological role in dephosphorylating rhodopsin. Once dephosphorylated, RHO can once again bind the chromophore 11 cis retinal (11cRAL), in readiness for the next photon response.

2012	8	adds_modification	Activated rhodopsin (MII aka R*) must be deactivated to terminate the single photon response. Deactivation begins during the rising phase of the single photon response after MII binds rhodopsin kinase (GRK1), a serine/threonine protein kinase (Khani et al. 1996). GRK1 is activated by MII whereupon it phosphorylates MII at multiple serine and threonine sites on its C terminus. There are six serine and threonine residues that can be phosphorylated. Increasing phosphorylation progressively reduces the rate at which MII can activate transducin but full quenching requires the binding of arrestin (S-antigen or SAG, Yamaki et al. 1988) which binds to and sterically caps MII (Burns & Pugh 2010, Korenbrot 2012).<br><br>A substantial fraction of rhodopsin kinase (GRK1) is bound to recoverin (RCVRN) in darkness, when internal Ca2+ levels are high. RCVRN is an EF-hand protein (Murakami et al. 1992) that functions as a myristoyl switch. With Ca2+ bound, the myristoyl group is exposed to attach RCVRN to the membrane. When Ca2+ levels drop with light exposure, Ca2+ dissociates from RCVRN and GRK1 is released. Higher levels of free GRK1 accelerate the phosphorylation and shutoff of photoexcited rhodopsin (MII).<br><br>Certain mutations in GRK1 cause Oguchi type 2 disease, a rare, recessive form of congenital stationary night blindness (https://sph.uth.edu/retnet/).

This is thought to promote translocation of E2F4 and E2F5, which lack nuclear localization signals, to the cytosol, allowing activating E2Fs (E2F1, E2F2 and E2F3) to bind E2F promoters and activate transcription of genes needed for G1 progression.	p21/p27__Cyclin D__phospho-CDK4/6;RBL2

Mutagenesis studies highlight the importance of tyrosine residue 724 in signaling mediated by FGFR3, including transformation, SHP2 phosphorylation, and activation of MAPK, PI3K and STAT pathways. These studies also identified a role for the PLCgamma-binding tyrosine residue, Y760, in STAT activation, and a potential role for tyrosine 770 as a negative regulator of FGFR3 signaling.
