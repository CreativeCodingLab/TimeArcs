2012	8	adds_modification	SLP-76 lacks intrinsic catalytic activity and acts as a scaffold, recruiting other proteins for correct localization during molecular signal transduction (Bogin et al. 2007). Activation of FCERI leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of SLP-76 (Gross et al. 1999). SLP-76 has three potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites within its amino terminus region: Y113, Y128, and Y145. Phosphorylation may be mediated by SYK, analogous to the role of ZAP-70 in phosphorylating T-cell SLP-76 (Bubeck-Wardenberg et al. 1996).	p-6Y-SYK;LCP2
2012	8	adds_modification	BTK/ITK are activated in a two step model. In the first step they are recruited to the membrane by binding to PIP3 or, alternatively with other binding partners like SLP-76. Once at the membrane SYK or Src-kinases in the vicinity phosphorylates Y551 (Y512 in ITK) in the activation loop of the catalytic domain of BTK to fully activate it (Rawlings et al. 1996, Park et al. 1996, Kawakami et al. 1994).	p-6Y-SYK;TEC

2012	8	adds_modification	SHC is an adapter protein that has been implicated in Ras activation. Mast cells express two isoforms of 46 and 52 kDa. Both isoforms of SHC have two domains, an N-terminal phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain and a C-terminal SH2 domain that allows Shc to bind to proteins containing phosphorylated tyrosine residues. Following receptor stimulation, SHC is phosphorylated by Src kinases Syk on Y239, Y240 and Y317 (p56 isoform). Both phosphotyrosines Y239 and Y317 creates the binding site for the SH2 domain of GRB2.	p-6Y-SYK;SHC1
2012	8	adds_modification	NTAL and LAT play complementary roles in the positive regulation of FCERI-mediated degranulation. Upon FCERI aggregation NTAL is phosphorylated by LYN, SYK and KIT on different tyrosines. Phosphorylated NTAL likely contributes to the activation of mast cells by providing docking sites for the recruitment of critical signaling molecules into the lipid raft. There are about ten tyrosines in LAT2 of which five tyrosines principally phosphorylated by SYK are recognised as putative GRB2-binding sites, being part of a YXN motif, whereas LYN and KIT phosphorylate both tyrosines contained in the YXN motifs as well as tyrosines outside of the YXN motifs (Iwaki et al. 2008).	p-6Y-SYK;NTAL
2012	8	adds_modification	LAT is palmitoylated and membrane-associated adaptor protein. It rapidly becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated upon receptor engagement. LAT has nine conserved tyrosine residues of which five have been shown to undergo phosphorylation (Y127, Y132, Y171, Y191 and Y226). Src family kinases, SYK and ZAP-70 efficiently phosphorylate LAT on these tyrosine residues (Jiang & Cheng 2007, Paz et al. 2001). Phosphorylation of LAT creates binding sites for the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain proteins PLC-gamma1, GRB2 and GADS, which indirectly bind SOS, VAV, SLP-76 and ITK (Wange 2000).	p-6Y-SYK;LAT

2013	8	adds_modification	PLK1 phosphorylates FOXM1 on serine residues S730 and S739 (S715 and S724 in FOXM1B isoform) in the C-terminal transactivation domain (TAD). PLK1-mediated phosphorylation of FOXM1 upregulates FOXM1 transcriptional activity and is crucial for FOXM1 function at G2/M transition (Fu et al. 2008).	p-T611-FOXM1__p-T210-PLK1;FOXM1
2012	8	translocation	Ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase UCHL5 (UCH37) deubiquitinates TGFBR1, stabilizing TGF-beta receptor complex and prolonging TGF-beta receptor signaling. Deubiqutination of SMAD7 by UCHL5 has not been examined in this context (Wicks et al. 2005). Ubiquitin peptidase USP15 also deubiquitinates and stabilizes TGFBR1, leading to enhanced signaling by TGF-beta receptor complex. USP15 does not affect the ubiquitination status of SMAD7. Amplification of USP15 has recently been reported in glioblastoma, breast and ovarian cancer. In advanced glioblastoma, TGF-beta receptor signaling acts as an oncogenic factor, and USP15-mediated upregulation of TGF-beta receptor signaling may be a key factor in glioblastoma pathogenesis (Eichhorn et al. 2012). The role of UCHL5 was inferred from experiments using recombinant mouse Uchl5 and Smad7 with recombinant human TGF-beta receptors. The role of USP15 was established by experiments using human proteins.	UCHL5/USP15;UBC

2012	8	adds_modification	CARMA1 (CARD11/Caspase recruitment domain-containing protein 11), BCL10 (B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 10) and MALT1 (Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation protein 1)/paracaspase have been identified as signaling components that act downstream of PKC-theta. CARMA1 is a scaffold protein and recruits BCL10, MALT1, PKC and TRAF6 to form a multi protein complex. CARMA1 exists in an inactive conformation in which the linker region binds to and blocks the accessibility of the CARD motif. Upon stimulation S552 and S645 linker residues are phosphorylated by PKC-theta and this may weaken this interaction, inducing an open conformation of CARMA1. Further phosphorylation studies have revealed other phosphorylation sites (S109, S551 and S555) that may also promote activation of CARMA1. Serene/threonine kinases PKC-beta, IKKbeta, HPK1 and CaMKII are involved in triggering CARMA1 activation (Thome et al. 2010, Rueda & Thome 2005). (only phosphorylated S552 and S645 are represented in this reaction)	DAG__p-5Y-PKC-theta;CAR11

2010	8	translocation	MyD88 and Tollip only bind to non-phosphorylated IRAK1 [Wesche et al. 1997) so hyper-phosphorylated IRAK1 is predisposed to release from the receptor complex, a key step in this signaling cascade. It is believed that the interaction of IRAK1 with TRAF6 enables the release of IRAK1:TRAF6 from the receptor (Gottipati et al. 2007). Though released from the receptor complex, IRAK1:TRAF6 remains associated with the membrane, perhaps due to subsequent interaction with the TAK1 complex (Dong et al. 2006).	IRAK3;TOLIP

2012	8	adds_modification	In darkness, the G protein transducin (Gt) is attached to the disk membrane surface with a GDP bound to it and it is inactive. Gt is a heterotrimer of alpha1 (GNAT1) (van Dop et al. 1989, Fong 1992), beta1 (GNB1) (Codina et al. 1986) and gamma1 (GNGT1) (Tao et al. 1993) subunits. Photoactivated rhodopsin (MII or R*) catalyzes the exchange of GTP for GDP bound to Gt. Upon GTP/GDP exchange, Gt is released from MII and the Gt alpha with GTP bound (GNAT1 GTP) dissociates from Gt beta gamma subunits (GNB1:GNGT1). This mechanism was deciphered from bovine experiments (Pugh & Lamb 1993). MII proceeds to activate additional Gt molecules, making this reaction the first amplification step in the phototransduction cascade. A single activated rhodopsin molecule activates tens of Gt molecules. Although phosphorylation of activated rhodopsin (MII) by rhodopsin kinase (GRK1) reduces transducin activation (Khani et al. 1996), complete deactivation occurs only after arrestin (S-antigen or SAG, Yamaki et al. 1988) binds to and sterically caps MII.<br><br>Defects in GNAT1 cause the Nougaret type of autosomal dominant, congenital stationary night blindness (Dryja et al. 1996, CSNBAD3; MIM:610444) .

2003	8	removes_modification	Protein phosphatase 2A removes the phosphates from phosphorylated rhodopsin (p MII) and phosphorylated opsin (p-RHO) (Fowles et al. 1989, Palczewski et al. 1989a,b). A Ca2+ dependent opsin phosphatase is also present (Kutuzov & Bennett 1996). Serine/threonine protein phosphatases with EF hands (PPEF1 and 2) that share homology with Drosophila retinal degeneration C (rdgC) are expressed in retina and may be responsible (Huang & Honkanen 1998), there is no evidence for a physiological role in dephosphorylating rhodopsin. Once dephosphorylated, RHO can once again bind the chromophore 11 cis retinal (11cRAL), in readiness for the next photon response. Arrestin (S-antigen or SAG, Yamaki et al. 1988) binds to and sterically caps MII, preventing PPEF1 from dephosphorylating it.	PP7__Mg2+;OPSD

2008	8	adds_modification	PAK-2p34 is ubiquitinated prior to degradation (Jakobi et al., 2003). Here, ubiquitination of PAK-2p34 is described as occurring in the cytosol. However, to date it is not known whether this occurs in the nucleus or in the cytoplasm. Evidence for this reaction comes from experiments using both human and rabbit proteins. The polyubiquitin synthesized in the reaction is inferred to contain lysine-48 (K48) linkages because the modified protein is targeted to the proteasome (Komander 2009).	Ubiquitin ligase;PAK2

2003	8	adds_modification	The membrane associated cGMP phosphodiesterase 6 (PDE6) is a tetramer of two catalytic chains, alpha (PDE6A or PDEA) (Pittler et al. 1990) and beta (PDE6B or PDEB) (Weber et al. 1991), and two inhibitory gamma chains (PDE6G or PDEG) (Tuteja et al. 1990). Binding of an activated transducin alpha subunit (GNAT1-GTP) to PDE-gamma relaxes the inhibitory effect of the gamma subunit thereby activating the associated alpha or beta catalytic subunit. Because the binding of GNAT1-GTP to PDE-gamma is one to one, there is no amplification associated with this step. Active Gt alpha (GNAT-GTP) can be inactivated by a slow, intrinsic GTPase activity that hydrolyses GTP to GDP. Once GNAT1 has GDP bound, it no longer binds to the gamma subunit of PDE6 (PDE6-gamma) that then resumes inhibition of the catalytic subunit of PDE6. Some forms of autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa and congenital stationary night blindness are caused by mutations in PDE6 (https://sph.uth.edu/retnet/).<br>	GDP__N-ACYL-GNAT1;GNAT1

2013	8	adds_modification	Phosphorylation of NUP98 by NEK6 (and/or NEK7) promotes nuclear envelope permeabilization by initiating nuclear pore complex (NPC) disassembly. Two NUP98 serine residues, S591 and S822 (referring to NUP98 splice variant NUP98-4; these residues correspond to S608 and S839 of NUP98 splice variant NUP98-3), are phosphorylated on NUP98 isolated from mitotic HeLa cells (human cervical cancer cell line). These serine residues match the NEK6 target site consensus and are phosphorylated by NEK6 in vitro. Both sites can also be phosphorylated in vitro by NEK7 and weakly by NEK2. As NEK7 but not NEK2 was shown to be involved, with NEK6, in nuclear envelope permeabilization, NEK2 is not shown as the NUP98 kinase. Phosphorylated NUP98 dissociates from the NPC (Laurell et al. 2011).

Two NUP98 serine residues, S591 and S822 (referring to NUP98 splice variant NUP98-4; these residues correspond to S608 and S839 of NUP98 splice variant NUP98-3), are phosphorylated on NUP98 isolated from mitotic HeLa cells (human cervical cancer cell line). These serine residues match the NEK6 target site consensus and are phosphorylated by NEK6 in vitro. Both sites can also be phosphorylated in vitro by NEK7 and weakly by NEK2.

MNK1 appears not to form a complex with Sprouty2. Some of these (including the two main sites mentioned above) conform to the serine-containing consensus sites for phosphorylation by MNK1 kinase (K/R-X-X-S, R-X-S). It appears that serine phosphorylation is required to protect Sprouty2 from degradation.<br><br>In the absence of serine phosphorylation, phosphorylation of Tyr55 and subsequent binding to E3 ubiquitin ligase, CBL, is enhanced. Serine phosphorylation of Sprouty2 appears to stabilise the protein by interfering with its potential phosphorylation of Tyr55 (Sprouty2 appears to be a poor substrate for c-Src kinase) in response to growth factor stimulation.	p- MNK1;SPY2

2013	8	adds_modification	Phosphorylation of WDR77 (MEP50) on threonine-5 by cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4), as part of the complex cyclin D1: CDK4:PRMT5:WDR77 enhances PRMT5:WDR77 methyltransferase activity, which triggers events associated with cyclin D1-dependent neoplastic growth (Aggarwal et al. 2011). Cyclin D1 is an allosteric regulator of CDK4 and CDK6, mediating growth factor-dependent G1-phase progression. Growth factor stimulation induces cyclin D1 expression, its association with CDK4 and nuclear accumulation during mid-G1. Active cyclin D1:CDK4 catalyzes the phosphorylation-dependent inactivation of retinoblastoma (RB) family proteins (Diehl 2002, Gladden & Diehl 2005). Following the G1/S transition, cyclin D1 accumulation is opposed by phosphorylation of threonine-286 (T286) by glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3beta), which promotes cyclin D1 nuclear export (Alt et al. 2000).

2013	8	adds_modification	Tyrosine phosphorylation of PRMT5 can block WDR77 (MEP50) binding, which attenuates PRMT5 activity (Liu et al. 2011). The kinase JAK2 is constitutively activated by the mutation V617F, observed in most patients with non-chronic myelogenous leukemia (nCML) myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) (Liu et al. 2011). JAK2 V617F can phosphorylate STAT5 in the absence of upstream signals, which confers cytokine-independent growth to Ba/F3 cells and induces a myeloproliferative disease in mouse models (Akada et al. 2010, Marty et al., 2010, Mullally et al. 2010). JAK2 V617F phosphorylates PRMT5 predominantly at tyrosines 297, 304, and 307, significantly reducing the activity-enhancing interaction between PRMT5 and WDR77 (MEP50) (Liu et al. 2011).

2012	8	translocation	E-cadherin (CDH1) localizes to the lateral membrane of differentiated epithelia, providing the structural foundation for adherens junctions, multiprotein complexes that link cell-cell contacts to the actin cytoskeleton and various signaling molecules (Perez-Moreno et al. 2003, Baum & Georgiou 2011). The extracellular domain has five cadherin-type repeat ectodomain (EC) modules; the most membrane-distal EC mediates binding with CDH1 on adjacent cells (Boggon et al. 2002). Calcium ions bind between the EC domains of two CDH1 peptides to form a dimer with a rod-like conformation (Boggon et al. 2002) which is required for cell-cell interaction (Gumbiner 1996, Patel et al. 2006). The cytoplasmic tail of E-cadherin binds to the armadillo repeat protein beta-catenin, a target of the Wnt signaling pathway and a cofactor for TCF/LEF-mediated transcription (Gavard & Mège 2005). Beta-catenin in turn binds alpha-catenin, which interacts with the actin microfilament network, actin and the actin-binding proteins vinculin, formins, alpha-actinin, zonula occludin protein, and afadin (Bershadsky 2004). Cellcell adhesions also contain desmosomes, which link cell contacts to intermediate filaments, and nectin-based, calcium-independent adhesions, which are linked to actin (Takai & Nakanishi 2003, Yin and Green 2004). The critical importance of E-cadherin to normal development and tissue function is demonstrated by embryonic lethal E-cadherin gene mouse knockouts (Larue et al. 1994). Loss of cadherin-based cell-cell adhesion is a hallmark of carcinogenesis, correlating with tumour progression, allowing cells to escape normal growth control signals, resulting in loss of differentiation and increased cell proliferation associated with invasive behaviour (Frixen et al. 1991, Capaldo & Macara 2007). Full-length 120-kDa CDH1 protein is cleaved in the ectodomain close to the plasma membrane by a number of metalloproteases, generating an extracellular 38-kDa C-terminal fragment (CTF) termed CTF1 which can be further processed by a gamma-secretase-like activity to a soluble 33-kDa CTF2 (Marambaud et al. 2002, Roy & Berx 2008). MMP3, MMP7 (Noë et al. 2001, canine MMPs), MMP9 (Symowicz et al. 2007), plasmin (Ryniers et al. 2002, canine plasmin), Kallikrien 7 (Johnson et al. 2007), ADAM10 (Maretzky et al. 2005) and ADAM15 (Najy et al. 2008) all cleave CDH1 extracellularly, close to the transmembrane region. Presenilin-1 (Marambaud et al. 2002), the catalytic subunit of gamma-secretase (Herreman et al. 2003, Li et al. 2003), cleaves CDH1 producing a soluble 33-kDa fragment termed CTF2. Other enzymes like caspase-3 (Steinhusen et al. 2001) and calpain-1 (Rios-Doria et al. 2003) cleave E-cadherin in its cytoplasmic part releasing an intracellular 37 kDa C-terminal fragment.

Mutation of PHF8 phosphorylation sites impairs the dissociation of PHF8 from chromatin and the accumulation of H4K20me1 in prophase (Liu et al. 2010). Positions of CDK1-phosphorylated serine residues in PHF8, S33 and S84, are based on the sequence of PHF8 splicing isoform 2, which was used in the experiments of Liu et al. In PHF8 splicing isoforms 1 and 3, serine residues S69 and S120 are annotated as targets of CDK1-mediated phosphorylation.	p-T161-CDK1__CCNB1;H31T

2012	8	adds_modification	At the beginning of mitosis, MASTL (GWL, Greatwall kinase) is activated by phosphorylation at several key sites. Many of these sites, including functionally important threonine residues T194, T207 and T741 (corresponding to Xenopus residues T193, T206 and T748), are proline directed, matching CDK1 consensus sequence, and thus probably phosphorylated by CDK1, as shown by in vitro studies (Yu et al. 2006. Blake-Hodek et al. 2012). Phosphorylation of the serine residue S875 (S883 in Xenopus) is implicated as critical for the mitotic function of MASTL (Vigneron et al. 2011) and likely occurs through autophosphorylation (Blake-Hodek et al. 2012). Other kinases, such as PLK1 (Vigneron et al. 2011) and other MASTL phosphorylation sites may also be involved in mitotic activation of MASTL (Yu et al. 2006, Vigneron et al. 2011, Blake-Hodek et al. 2012). Phosphorylation of the serine residue S102 (S101 in Xenopus) is functionally important but the responsible kinase has not been identified (Blake-Hodek et al. 2012).	p-T161-CDK1__CCNB1;GWL

In vivo, phosphorylation of NCAPD3 threonine residue T1415 is blocked when cells are treated with CDK1 inhibitors. In addition, it was shown that CDK1 in complex with cyclin B1 (CDK1:CCNB1) phosphorylates NCAPD3 at T1415 in vitro (Abe et al. 2011).	p-T161-CDK1__CCNB1;CNDD3

2012	8	adds_modification	Multiple sites of phosphorylation are known to exist in SYK, which both regulate its activity and also serve as docking sites for other proteins. Some of these sites include Y131 of interdomain A, Y323, Y348, and Y352 of interdomain B, and Y525 and Y526 within the activation loop of the kinase domain and Y630 in the C-terminus (Zhang et al. 2002, Lupher et al. 1998, Furlong et al. 1997). Phosphorylation of these tyrosine residues disrupts autoinhibitory interactions and results in kinase activation even in the absence of phosphorylated ITAM tyrosines (Tsang et al. 2008). SYK is primarily phosphorylated by Src family kinases and this acts as an initiating trigger by generating few molecules of activated SYK which are then involved in major SYK autophosphorylation (Hillal et al. 1997).

The histone methyltransferase activity of EZH2 also trimethylates lysine-27 of histone H3 (H3K27me3). The promoters of the MYT, WNT1, KCNA1, and CNR1 genes are methylated on cytosine by the DNMT:PRC2 complex however not all loci that have H3K27me3 by PRC2 also have cytosine methylation (Vire et al. 2006, Brinkman et al. 2012). DNA methylation and H3K27me3 appear to be mutually exclusive in CpG islands but are compatible throughout most of the rest of the genome (Brinkman et al. 2012). In mouse, DNA methylation and H3K27me3 appear to be antagonistic at most loci: loss of DNA methylation causes increased H3K27me3 while loss of PRC2 has little effect on DNA methylation (Hagarman et al. 2013). By competing with DNMT3a,b for association with PRC2, DNMT3L may antagonize DNA methylation at sites bound by PRC2 (Neri et al. 2013).	DNMT1,3A,3B;H32

The 3-Hyp content of collagen is much more variable than that of 4-Hyp, varying between collagen types, tissues, developmental stages and pathological states (Kivirikko et al. 1992). It is more prevalent in type IV and V collagens at 10-15 3-Hyp residues (Bentz et al. 1983) than in Type I-III fibrillar collagens which have a single 3-Hyp residue per chain; the alpha-1 chain of type I collagen has 3-Hyp at residue 986 (Fietzek et al. 1972, Marini et al. 2007). 3-Hyp is formed from Pro in the Xaa position of Xaa-Hyp-Gly triplets (Gryder et al. 1975, Kivirikko et al. 1992). It is likely that 4-Hyp is a requirement at the second position of the triplet as 4-Hyp rich substrates are more active than 4-Hyp poor (Adams & Frank 1980). 3-Hyp has a modest effect on triple-helix stability (Jenkins et al. 2003; Mizuno et al. 2008). 3-Hyp may adjust the stability of basement membranes to enable formation of the meshwork structure, or serve as a ligand for other proteins.

Like P4H, P3H requires molecular oxygen, alpha-ketoglutarate, iron(II), and ascorbate for activity. P3H1 is homologous to mammalian leprecan or growth suppressor 1 (Gros1), and forms a 3-prolyl hydroxylation complex with cartilage-associated protein (CRTAP) and a peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase, cyclophilin B (CypB), which is encoded by the PPIB gene (Vranka et al. 2004).

It is more prevalent in type IV and V collagens at 10-15 3-Hyp residues (Bentz et al. 1983) than in Type I-III fibrillar collagens which have a single 3-Hyp residue per chain; the alpha-1 chain of type I collagen has 3-Hyp at residue 986 (Fietzek et al. 1972, Marini et al. 2007). 3-Hyp is formed from Pro in the Xaa position of Xaa-Hyp-Gly triplets (Gryder et al. 1975, Kivirikko et al. 1992). It is likely that 4-Hyp is a requirement at the second position of the triplet as 4-Hyp rich substrates are more active than 4-Hyp poor (Adams & Frank 1980). 3-Hyp has a modest effect on triple-helix stability (Jenkins et al. 2003; Mizuno et al. 2008). 3-Hyp may adjust the stability of basement membranes to enable formation of the meshwork structure, or serve as a ligand for other proteins. It is suggested to have a role in the self-assembly of collagen supramolecular structures (Weis et al. 2010). <br>3-Hyp is formed by prolyl 3-hydroxylase (P3H; EC 1.14.11.7), which has 3 isoforms in vertebrates. All contain an ER-retention signal but vary in their tissue expression (Vranka et al. 2009). P3H can hydroxylate prolines that precede 4-Hyp residues (Tryggvason et al. 1976) but not those that precede an unhydroxylated proline (Kivirikko & Myllla 1982, Myllyharju 2005). Like P4H, P3H requires molecular oxygen, alpha-ketoglutarate, iron(II), and ascorbate for activity. P3H1 is homologous to mammalian leprecan or growth suppressor 1 (Gros1), and forms a 3-prolyl hydroxylation complex with cartilage-associated protein (CRTAP) and a peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase, cyclophilin B (CypB), which is encoded by the PPIB gene (Vranka et al. 2004). Lack of 3-Hyp in Type I and II collagens leads to an osteogenesis imperfecta (OI)-like disease, as demonstrated by CRTAP and PPIB knock-out mice (Morello et al. 2006, Choi et al. 2009) and by mutations in human LEPRE1 (which encodes P3H1), CRTAP, and PPIB (Barnes et al. 2006, Cabral et al. 2007, van Dijk et al. 2009). The P3H1/CRTAP/CypB complex has also been shown to have chaperone activity (Ishikawa et al. 2009).

The 3-Hyp content of collagen is much more variable than that of 4-Hyp, varying between collagen types, tissues, developmental stages and pathological states (Kivirikko et al. 1992). It is more prevalent in type IV and V collagens at 10-15 3-Hyp residues (Bentz et al. 1983) than in Type I-III fibrillar collagens which have a single 3-Hyp residue per chain; the alpha-1 chain of type I collagen has 3-Hyp at residue 986 (Fietzek et al. 1972, Marini et al. 2007). 3-Hyp is formed from Pro in the Xaa position of Xaa-Hyp-Gly triplets (Gryder et al. 1975, Kivirikko et al. 1992). It is likely that 4-Hyp is a requirement at the second position of the triplet as 4-Hyp rich substrates are more active than 4-Hyp poor (Adams & Frank 1980). 3-Hyp has a modest effect on triple-helix stability (Jenkins et al. 2003; Mizuno et al. 2008). 3-Hyp may adjust the stability of basement membranes to enable formation of the meshwork structure, or serve as a ligand for other proteins.

All contain an ER-retention signal but vary in their tissue expression (Vranka et al. 2009). P3H can hydroxylate prolines that precede 4-Hyp residues (Tryggvason et al. 1976) but not those that precede an unhydroxylated proline (Kivirikko & Myllla 1982, Myllyharju 2005). Like P4H, P3H requires molecular oxygen, alpha-ketoglutarate, iron(II), and ascorbate for activity. P3H1 is homologous to mammalian leprecan or growth suppressor 1 (Gros1), and forms a 3-prolyl hydroxylation complex with cartilage-associated protein (CRTAP) and a peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase, cyclophilin B (CypB), which is encoded by the PPIB gene (Vranka et al. 2004). Lack of 3-Hyp in Type I and II collagens leads to an osteogenesis imperfecta (OI)-like disease, as demonstrated by CRTAP and PPIB knock-out mice (Morello et al. 2006, Choi et al. 2009) and by mutations in human LEPRE1 (which encodes P3H1), CRTAP, and PPIB (Barnes et al. 2006, Cabral et al. 2007, van Dijk et al. 2009).

Lack of 3-Hyp in Type I and II collagens leads to an osteogenesis imperfecta (OI)-like disease, as demonstrated by CRTAP and PPIB knock-out mice (Morello et al. 2006, Choi et al. 2009) and by mutations in human LEPRE1 (which encodes P3H1), CRTAP, and PPIB (Barnes et al. 2006, Cabral et al. 2007, van Dijk et al. 2009). The P3H1/CRTAP/CypB complex has also been shown to have chaperone activity (Ishikawa et al. 2009).

The 3-Hyp content of collagen is much more variable than that of 4-Hyp, varying between collagen types, tissues, developmental stages and pathological states (Kivirikko et al. 1992). It is more prevalent in type IV and V collagens at 10-15 3-Hyp residues (Bentz et al. 1983) than in Type I-III fibrillar collagens which have a single 3-Hyp residue per chain; the alpha-1 chain of type I collagen has 3-Hyp at residue 986 (Fietzek et al. 1972, Marini et al. 2007). 3-Hyp is formed from Pro in the Xaa position of Xaa-Hyp-Gly triplets (Gryder et al. 1975, Kivirikko et al. 1992). It is likely that 4-Hyp is a requirement at the second position of the triplet as 4-Hyp rich substrates are more active than 4-Hyp poor (Adams & Frank 1980). 3-Hyp has a modest effect on triple-helix stability (Jenkins et al. 2003; Mizuno et al. 2008). 3-Hyp may adjust the stability of basement membranes to enable formation of the meshwork structure, or serve as a ligand for other proteins.

P3H can hydroxylate prolines that precede 4-Hyp residues (Tryggvason et al. 1976) but not those that precede an unhydroxylated proline (Kivirikko & Myllla 1982, Myllyharju 2005). Like P4H, P3H requires molecular oxygen, alpha-ketoglutarate, iron(II), and ascorbate for activity. P3H1 is homologous to mammalian leprecan or growth suppressor 1 (Gros1), and forms a 3-prolyl hydroxylation complex with cartilage-associated protein (CRTAP) and a peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase, cyclophilin B (CypB), which is encoded by the PPIB gene (Vranka et al. 2004). Lack of 3-Hyp in Type I and II collagens leads to an osteogenesis imperfecta (OI)-like disease, as demonstrated by CRTAP and PPIB knock-out mice (Morello et al. 2006, Choi et al. 2009) and by mutations in human LEPRE1 (which encodes P3H1), CRTAP, and PPIB (Barnes et al. 2006, Cabral et al. 2007, van Dijk et al. 2009). The P3H1/CRTAP/CypB complex has also been shown to have chaperone activity (Ishikawa et al. 2009).

The 3-Hyp content of collagen is much more variable than that of 4-Hyp, varying between collagen types, tissues, developmental stages and pathological states (Kivirikko et al. 1992). It is more prevalent in type IV and V collagens at 10-15 3-Hyp residues (Bentz et al. 1983) than in Type I-III fibrillar collagens which have a single 3-Hyp residue per chain; the alpha-1 chain of type I collagen has 3-Hyp at residue 986 (Fietzek et al. 1972, Marini et al. 2007). 3-Hyp is formed from Pro in the Xaa position of Xaa-Hyp-Gly triplets (Gryder et al. 1975, Kivirikko et al. 1992). It is likely that 4-Hyp is a requirement at the second position of the triplet as 4-Hyp rich substrates are more active than 4-Hyp poor (Adams & Frank 1980). 3-Hyp has a modest effect on triple-helix stability (Jenkins et al. 2003; Mizuno et al. 2008). 3-Hyp may adjust the stability of basement membranes to enable formation of the meshwork structure, or serve as a ligand for other proteins.

It is likely that 4-Hyp is a requirement at the second position of the triplet as 4-Hyp rich substrates are more active than 4-Hyp poor (Adams & Frank 1980). 3-Hyp has a modest effect on triple-helix stability (Jenkins et al. 2003; Mizuno et al. 2008). 3-Hyp may adjust the stability of basement membranes to enable formation of the meshwork structure, or serve as a ligand for other proteins. It is suggested to have a role in the self-assembly of collagen supramolecular structures (Weis et al. 2010). <br>3-Hyp is formed by prolyl 3-hydroxylase (P3H; EC 1.14.11.7), which has 3 isoforms in vertebrates. All contain an ER-retention signal but vary in their tissue expression (Vranka et al. 2009). P3H can hydroxylate prolines that precede 4-Hyp residues (Tryggvason et al. 1976) but not those that precede an unhydroxylated proline (Kivirikko & Myllla 1982, Myllyharju 2005). Like P4H, P3H requires molecular oxygen, alpha-ketoglutarate, iron(II), and ascorbate for activity. P3H1 is homologous to mammalian leprecan or growth suppressor 1 (Gros1), and forms a 3-prolyl hydroxylation complex with cartilage-associated protein (CRTAP) and a peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase, cyclophilin B (CypB), which is encoded by the PPIB gene (Vranka et al. 2004). Lack of 3-Hyp in Type I and II collagens leads to an osteogenesis imperfecta (OI)-like disease, as demonstrated by CRTAP and PPIB knock-out mice (Morello et al. 2006, Choi et al. 2009) and by mutations in human LEPRE1 (which encodes P3H1), CRTAP, and PPIB (Barnes et al. 2006, Cabral et al. 2007, van Dijk et al. 2009). The P3H1/CRTAP/CypB complex has also been shown to have chaperone activity (Ishikawa et al. 2009).

2007	8	adds_modification	The intrinsic protein tyrosine kinase activity of activated FGF receptor 3 catalyzes multiple phosphorylation events, creating a number of binding sites on its cytoplasmic tail for membrane bound docking proteins to gather intracellular signaling mediators. Based on sequence alignment, FGFR3 contains 6 of the 8 cytoplasmic tyrosine residues identified in FGFR1. Mutagenesis studies highlight the importance of tyrosine residue 724 in signaling mediated by FGFR3, including transformation, SHP2 phosphorylation, and activation of MAPK, PI3K and STAT pathways. These studies also identified a role for the PLCgamma-binding tyrosine residue, Y760, in STAT activation, and a potential role for tyrosine 770 as a negative regulator of FGFR3 signaling.

2004	8	adds_modification	Cdk-9 is the kinase subunit of P-TEFb that phosphorylates Serine 2 on the heptapeptide repeats of Pol II CTD alleviating the negative action of DSIF-NELF complex. This reaction is considered to be a rate limiting step for processive elongation. P-TEFb complex, that has a DRB-sensitive cyclin-dependent kinase activity, is composed of ~43 kDa, Cdk9 kinase (PITALRE), and either Cyclin T1, Cyclin T2a, Cyclin T2b, or Cyclin K. The exact mechanism by which P-TEFb removes the inhibition of elongation by DSIF-NELF is not yet known. P-TEFb is also capable of phosphorylating Spt5 subunit of DSIF complex. <BR> A P-TEFb complex (which contains only the Cyclin T1) is implicated in the efficient synthesis of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) transcripts. Cyclin T1 subunit of the P-TEFb(Cyclin T1:Cdk9) complex interacts with HIV-1 encoded Tat protein that binds to the transactivation response (TAR) element in the nascent HIV-1 transcript (reviewed in Price,2000). <BR>The mechanism by which DSIF, NELF and P-TEFb or TAK/P-TEFb act together in Pol II-regulated elongation is yet to be fully understood. Various biochemical evidences point to a model in which DSIF and NELF negatively regulate elongation through interactions with polymerase containing a hypophosphorylated CTD. Subsequent phosphorylation of the Pol II CTD by P-TEFb might promote elongation by inhibiting interactions of DSIF and NELF with the elongation complex.<BR>	CCNT1__CCNT2__CDK9;RPB1

Moreover, inactive HSF1 was reported to constitutively shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm in mammalian cells (Vujanac M et al. 2005). However, active HSF1 trimers were shown to rapidly accumulate in the nucleus where they bind to heat shock elements (HSE) present within promoters of hsp genes (Wang Y and Morgan WD 1994; Herbomel G et al. 2013).<p>Heat shock response in human and monkey cells (but not rodent cells) is also associated with the stress-induced relocalization of HSF1 within the nucleus not only on hsp gene promoters but also into specific subnuclear organelles termed nuclear stress bodies (nSBs, also known as HSF1 granules) (Sarge KD et a. 1993; Cotto JJ et al. 1997; Jolly C et al. 1999). nSBs are rarely detectable in unstressed cells but their number drastically increases after heat shock. Formation of nSBs is initiated by the interaction between HSF1 and pericentric tandem repeats of satellite III sequences on chromosome 9, where sat III repeats are transcribed by RNA polymerase II in an HSF1-dependent manner. (Jolly C et al. 2002, 2004). HSF1 can also bind to DNA regions enriched in sat II and sat III repeated sequences detected on other human chromosomes (Eymery A et al. 2010). The functional relevance of HSF1 granules and their transcripts remains an open question.	YWHAE;HSF1

2013	8	adds_modification	P130CAS (CRK-associated substrate/BCAR1) contains multiple protein-protein interaction domains including an N-terminal SH3 domain, an interior substrate domain (SD), a Src-binding domain (SBD) near the C-terminus and a conserved C-terminal Cas-family homology (CCH) domain. The SH3 and CCH domains mediate localization to focal adhesions (FAs) while SD and SBD are involved in initiating signaling events (Meenderink et al. 2010, Shin et al. 2004). The p130CAS SD undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation and mediates signals by recruiting downstream effectors. The SD is characterised by fifteen YxxP motifs, of which ten can be efficiently phosphorylated by Src family kinases (SFKs) (Shin et al. 2004). FAK kinase phosphorylates the nearby SBD tyrosines 664 and 666 (mouse 668/670). These SBD tyrosines provide the additional binding sites for Src-SH2 domains, stabilizing the SRC-p130CAS association (Ruest et al. 2001).

Two threonine residues at positions 1400 and 1412 (analogous to 1381 and 1393 in mouse) in the activation loop of MEKK1 between the kinase subdomains VII and VIII are essential for its catalytic activity. The catalytic domain of MEKK1 is able to autophosphorylate these residues, enhancing its own activity.	MEKK1;M3K1
2014	8	adds_modification	Although direct phosphorylation of GLI1 by PKA has not been demonstrated, deletion of the putative PKA sites abrogates the interaction of GLI1 with beta-TrCP and stabilizes GLI1 protein levels; similarly, treatment of GLI1-expressing cells with PKA inhibitors delays the kinetics of GLI1 degradation (Huntzicker et al, 2006). These data are consistent with a role for PKA-mediated phosphorylation in promoting the proteasome-dependent degradation of GLI1 in the absence of Hh signal, as is the case for GLI2 and GLI3 (Huntzicker et al, 2006; Tempe et al, 2006; Pan and Wang, 2007; Pan et al, 2009). Potential roles for CK2 and GSK3 in promoting the phosphorylation-dependent degradation of GLI1 have not been investigated.	PRKACG__PRKACA__PRKACB;GLI1

Ubiquitinated TRAF6 trimer, acts as a E3 ligase and induces this ubiquitination. The ubiquitin target sites in NEMO are not yet clearly identified. Studies of different NF-kB signaling pathways revealed several potential ubiquitination sites on NEMO (e.g., K285, K277, K309 and K399) (Fuminori et al. 2009).	K63polyUb TRAF6;NEMO

Phosphorylation of this site is critical for the PKC theta kinase activity, and its ability to activate NF-kB pathway. PKC theta is later trans-autophopshorylated on putative phosphorylation sites (S676, S695) for the fine-tuning of its kinase activity.	PIP3, PI(3,4)P2__PDK1;KPCT

BRCA1 plays an important role in the response to double-strand breaks, participating in genome surveillance, DNA repair, and cell cycle checkpoint arrests. BRCA1 is required for ATM-dependent phosphorylation of NBS1 following exposure to ionizing radiation (Foray et al., 2003). BRCA1 also interacts with the MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 complex which has been implicated early in HRR during resection of the double-strand break.	p-S1981-ATM;BRCA1

2014	8	removes_modification	CTDNEP1:CNEP1R1 serine/threonine protein phosphatase complex consists of the catalytic subunit CTDNEP1 (Dullard) and the regulatory subunit CNEP1R1 (TMEM188) and is evolutionarily conserved from yeast to mammals (Kim et al. 2007, Han et al. 2012). CTDNEP1:CNEP1R1 and its yeast counterpart NEM1:SPO7 localize to the nuclear envelope and the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. CTDNEP1:CNEP1R1 dephosphorylates lipins (LPIN1, LPIN2 and LPIN3), which act as phosphatidate phosphatases, dephosphorylating phosphatidate (PA) and converting it to diacylglycerol (DAG). The yeast NEM1:SPO7 complex dephosphorylates yeast lipin orthologue PAH1 (SMP2, PAP1). CTDNEP1:CNEP1R1 shows a preference for the phosphorylated serine S106 of lipins. S106 phosphorylation is insulin-induced, and could be mediated by CDK1, as it is proline-directed (Wu et al. 2011). CDC28, a yeast homolog of CDK1, was shown to phosphorylate PAH1, while NEM1:SPO7 removes CDC28-introduced phosphate groups. Lipin phosphorylation regulates lipin localization, with phosphorylated lipins being soluble and dephosphorylated lipins being membrane-bound (Grimsey et al. 2008, Choi et al. 2011). The association of lipins with the nuclear envelope brings lipins in proximity to its substrate, PA, thereby enabling lipin catalytic activity (Karanasios et al. 2010). Catalytic activity of PAH1 regulates the morphology and dynamics of endoplasmic reticulum and nuclear membranes in yeast. In C. elegans and in human cell lines, lipin catalytic activity is needed for mitotic progression as it facilitates depolymerization of the nuclear lamina and nuclear envelope breakdown (Santos-Rosa et al. 2005, Kim et al. 2007, Gorjanacz et al. 2009, Golden et al. 2009, Choi et al. 2011, Mall et al. 2012).

Phosphorylation occurs on serine and threonine residues in 2 clusters and appears to be primed by phosphorylation at S5, S82 and S84. VANGL2 phosphorylation and activation occurs in a graded fashion in response to WNT5A distribution, helping to establish PCP asymmetry (Gao et al, 2011).	unknown kinase;VANG2

2010	8	adds_modification	GH has short term effects that mimic the actions of insulin in tissues that have been deprived of GH, including increased amino acid transport, glucose transport, and lipogenesis (Davidson 1987). GH and insulin have overlapping signaling pathways (Dominici et al. 2005). GH stimulates tyrosyl phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) (Souza et al. 1994, Thirone et al. 1999), and IRS-2 (Argetsinger et al. 1996, Thirone et al. 1999), although more modestly than insulin or IGF-1. Tyrosyl phosphorylation of IRS-1 and IRS-2 in response to insulin provides binding sites for specific proteins containing SH2 domains, including the 85-kDa regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), tyrosine phosphatase SHP2, and Grb2. This is one of several mechanisms proposed to explain the stimulatory effect of GH on the PI3-kinase/Akt pathway (Jin et al. 2008). GH promotes the binding of the 85-kDa regulatory subunit of PI3K to IRS-1 and IRS-2 in cultured cells (Ridderstrale et al. 1995, Argetsinger et al. 1995, 1996). Studies using truncated or mutated GHRs suggest that tyrosyl phosphorylation of IRS-1, IRS-2, and Shc is dependent on JAK2 activation (Argetsinger et al. 1995, 1996, VanderKuur et al. 1995). Despite a strong correlation between JAK2 activation and IRS phosphorylation it is not clear whether there is a direct association. JAK2 has been reported to interact directly with IRS in response to angiotensin II (Velloso et al. 1996) but also reported to interact indirectly via SH2B in response to leptin (Duan et al.2004).

BRCA1 is required for ATM-dependent phosphorylation of NBS1 following exposure to ionizing radiation (Foray et al., 2003).

2010	8	adds_modification	Cbl is tyrosine phosphorylated following stimulation with IL-3 (Anderson et al. 1997) and GM-CSF (Odai et al. 1995). Cbl may be phosphorylated prior to this IL-3 stimulated tyrosyl phosphorylation (Park et al. 1998). The kinase responsible for Cbl phosphorylation may be dependent on cell type; Fyn is demonstrated to have the ability to phosphorylate Cbl (Hunter et al. 1999), other candidates include Hck, Lyn (Hunter et al. 1999) and Syk (Park et al. 1998).<br><br> Tyrosines 700, 731 and 774 are the major sites of Cbl phosphorylation by non-receptor protein tyrosine kinases, with none showing any particular specificity for sites (Tsygankov et al. 2001). Fyn was observed to be constitutively associated with Cbl in lysates of several different cell types including the interleukin-3-dependent murine myeloid cell line 32Dcl3, and the prolactin-dependent rat thymoma cell line Nb2. Cbl phosphorylation at Y731 is postulated to provide an additional interaction between Cbl and the SH2 domain of p85-PI3K (Hunter et al. 1999). Cbl-p85 association increases in activated cells (Panchamoorthy et al. 1996). Expression of a Cbl Y731F mutant which abolishes binding of Cbl to p85 markedly increased levels of p85-PI3K (Dufour et al. 2008). Cbl-p85 binding negatively regulates PI3K activity (Fang et al. 2001); Cbl phosphorylation increased PI3K ubiquitination and proteasome degradation (Dufour et al. 2008). Cbl association with members of the Crk family is mediated by phosphorylation of Y700 and Y774 (Andoniou et al. 1996), binding with Vav is mediated by Y770 (Marengere et al 1997).

2007	8	translocation	Alpha5beta1 integrin was the first integrin shown to bind fibronectin (FN1). Unlike other FN1-binding integrins it is a specialist at this task. In solution FN1 occurs as a dimer. Binding to alpha5beta1 integrin stimulates FN1 self-association; blocking the RGD-cell binding domain of FN1 blocks fibril formation (Fogerty et al. 1990). FN1 binding is believed to induce integrin clustering, which promotes FN1-FN1 interactions. Integrin clustering is mediated by association between integrins and intracellular actin stress fibers (Calderwood et al. 2000). Binding of integrins to each of the monomers in the FN1 dimer pair is thought to trigger a conformational change in FN1 that exposes 'cryptic' FN1 binding sites that allow additional fibronectin dimers to bind without the requirement for pre-association with integrins (Singh et al. 2010). This non-covalent interaction may involve interactions with fibrillin (Ohashi & Erickson 2009). I1-5 functions as a unit that is the primary FN matrix assembly domain (Sottile et al. 1991) but other units are likely to be involved (Singh et al. 2010). Other integrins able to bind FN1 include alphaIIbBeta3, which is highly expressed on platelets where it predominantly binds fibrinogen leading to thrombus formation but also binds FN1 (Savage et al. 1996). Alpha4beta1 mediates cell-cell contacts and cell-matrix contacts through the ligands VCAM-1 and FN1, respectively (Humphries et al. 1995). Integrins alpha3beta1, alpha4beta7, alphaVbeta1, 3 (Johansson et al. 1997), 6 (Busk et al. 1992) and alpha8beta1 (Muller et al. 1995, Farias et al. 2005) are all able to bind FN1. <br><br>Tenacious binding of free fibronectin to cells leads to enhanced fibronectin matrix assembly and the formation of a polymerized fibronectin "cocoon" around the cells. This process is enhanced in the presence of CEACAM molecules.	Neutrophil CEACAMs affecting integrin binding to fibronectin;FINC

2006	8	translocation	BAMBI (BMP and activin membrane-bound inhibitor) is a transmembrane protein closely related to TGF-beta family receptors type I, but without serine/threonine kinase activity. In Xenopus, BAMBI expression is regulated by BMP4. BAMBI interferes with BMP, activin and TGF-beta receptor complex signaling. BAMBI binds various TGF-beta type I receptors, showing the highest affinity for TGFBR1. BAMBI can also bind TGFBR2 and activin receptor type II (Onichtchouk et al. 1999). BAMBI binds SMAD7, and this interaction involves MH1 and MH2 domains of SMAD7 and the intracellular domain of BAMBI. BAMBI and SMAD7 cooperate in the repression of TGF-beta receptor complex signaling, but BAMBI-mediated recruitment of SMAD7 to activated TGF-beta receptor complex, as BAMBI preferentially binds activated TGFBR1, does not lead to TGFBR1 degradation (Yan et al. 2009). BAMBI may downregulate TGF-beta receptor complex signaling by replacing one TGFBR1 molecule in the TGF-beta receptor heterotetramer (Onichtchouk et al. 1999). Alternatively, BAMBI-mediated recruitment of SMAD7 may compete with binding of SMAD2 and SMAD3 (R-SMADs) to the activated TGF-beta receptor complex, thus interfering with the activation of R-SMADs (Yan et al. 2009).

2013	8	adds_modification	The transcriptional activity of HSF1 has been shown to be controlled by the regulatory domain composed of amino acids 221-310 (Green M et al. 1995; Zuo J et al. 1995; Newton EM et al., 1996). Ser230 is located in this regulatory domain of HSF1 and is constitutively and stress-inducibly phosphorylated (Holmberg CI et al. 2001). Analyses with phosphopeptide-specific antibody and site-directed mutagenesis revealed that phosphorylation at Ser230 enhanced the inducible HSF1 transcriptional activity in heat-shocked human K562 erythroleukemia and HeLa cells (Holmberg CI et al 2001). Active calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) was shown to phosphorylate HSF1 at Ser230 in vitro. Moreover, CaMKII enhanced heat-induced tranactivating capacity of HSF1 and the level of endogenous Ser230 phosphorylation in K562 cells transfected with active CaMKII together with a CAT reporter plasmid containing the proximal HSE of human hsp70 promoter. Thus, CaMKII signaling may be involved in the positive regulation of HSF1-mediated transactivation. However, the possibility that other protein kinases might also phosphorylate Ser230 in vivo should not be excluded (Holmberg CI et al 2001).

Once inside, CRs containing all-trans-retinyl esters (atREs) can be directly and rapidly taken up by liver parenchymal cells via the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) using apolipoprotein E (apoE) as a ligand. Internalization of remnants occur via endocytosis (see review D'Ambrosio et al. 2011). This reaction is inferred from uptake studies in mice (Yu et al. 2000). Defects in LDLR cause familial hypercholesterolemia (FH, MIM:143890), a common autosomal disease that affects about 1 in 500 people in most countries. Abnormal LDLR doesn't remove LDL from circulation resulting in high levels of LDL in blood, leading to early cardiovascular disease via atherosclerosis.

In humans almost all circulating GLP-1 is GLP-1 (7-36) amidated at the C-terminus. Experiments in knockout mice have shown that PC1 is necessary for cleavage. Carboxypeptidase E and peptidylglycine alpha-amidating monooxygenase may be involved in trimming and amidating the C-terminus.	PCSK1__Ca2+;GLUC
2008	8	adds_modification	Cystine bonds are formed in Proinsulin-1 between cysteine residues 31 and 96, cysteine residues 43 and 109, and cysteine residues 95 and 100. Ero1-like alpha does not directly catalyze the oxidation of cysteines to cystine. Instead it maintains a suitably oxidizing environment for the reactions to occur . Though Ero1-like alpha can act via specific isomerases such as P4HB/PDI, there is currently no evidence that formation of cystine bonds in insulin requires a specific isomerase. Interestingly, even in beta cells of wild type animals, trace amounts of incorrectly bonded proinsulin can be detected. Thus, the formation of correct cystine bonds may involve a period of bond shuffling.	ERO1L__ERO1LB;INS

PLC hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol (PIP2) to diacyl glycerol (DAG) and inositol triphosphate (IP3). DAG acts as a second messenger that activates protein kinase C (PKC) and IP3 can bind to IP3 receptors, particular calcium channels in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Calcium flow causes the cytosolic concentration of calcium to increase, causing a cascade of intracellular changes and activity.	Ligand:GPCR complexes that activate Gq/11;GHRL

2006	8	translocation	Within early endosomes, p75NTR C-Terminal Fragment undergoes processing by gamma-secretase, a complex composed of a presenilin homodimer (PSEN1 or PSEN2), nicastrin (NCSTN), APH1 (APH1A or APH1B) and PEN2. Such a minimal complex is sufficient for secretase activity, although other components may exist. The p75NTR cleavage by gamma-secretase gives rise to a 20-kD ICD (IntraCellular Domain) fragment, and to a small peptide, the significance of which is unknown but that is analogous to the A-beta peptides generated from amyloid precursor protein. p75NTR ICD may have cytoplasmic and nuclear signalling functions and it is unstable.

2007	8	translocation	The viral polymerase complex produces positive-sense viral mRNA with host-cell derived 5' methyl caps. Capped viral mRNAs are selectively exported from the host cell nucleus through a currently unclear mechanism that may rely on components of the host cell mRNA export machinery (Chen, 2000; Engelhardt, 2006).

2013	8	adds_modification	NHLRC1 (malin) associates with the glycogen particle where it functions as a ubiquitin E3 ligase to mediate the polyubiquitination of EPM2A (laforin) and PPP1R3C (PTG). The two polyubiquitinated proteins are targeted for proteasome-mediated degradation, leaving a glycogen-GYG1 particle associated with GYS1 (Gentry et al. 2005, Worby et al. 2008). In NHLRC1 knockout mice, PPP1R3C levels are unchanged, rather than increased, suggesting that NHLRC1 does not target PPP1R3C for degradation. However, EPM2A protein levels are increased in this knockout consistent with NHLRC1s proposed role. (DePaoli-Roach et al. 2010).	malin;EPM2A

2013	8	adds_modification	Six tyrosine phosphorylation sites in focal adhesion kinase 1 (FAK1) serve to modulate FAK1 kinase activity or mediate FAK1 interaction with SH2-domain containing proteins. These are Y397, Y407, Y576, Y577, Y861 and Y925 (Mitra et al. 2005). They are differentially phosphorylated by diverse agonists and implicated in transmitting different signals and effects (Ciccimaro et al. 2006, Le Boeuf et al. 2004,2006). Y397 is the major autophosphorylation site present upstream of the FAK kinase domain (Schaller et al. 1994). In response to VEGF stimulation FAK1 is recruited and autophosphorylated at Y397. This phosphorylated tyrosine then creates a binding site for other signaling proteins that link FAK1 to downstream signaling pathways and the actin cytoskeleton (Toutant et al. 2002).	FAK;FAK1

Identification of the sheddases for EGFR ligands using mouse embryonic cells lacking candidate sheddases (a disintegrin and metalloprotease; ADAM) has revealed that ADAM10, -12 and -17 are the sheddases of the EGFR ligands in response to various shedding stimulants such as GPCR agonists, growth factors, cytokines, osmotic stress, wounding and phorbol ester. Among the EGFR ligands, heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF), EGF and TGF-alpha are the best characterized.	ADAM metalloprotease__Zn2+;EGF

2003	8	removes_modification	With insulin dissociated from its receptor the signal to sustain the receptor kinase's activity is also removed. Thus endosomally-associated protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) are able to dephosphorylate the receptor which now can not rephosphorylate themselves since insulin is removed and the receptor is in the inactive protein conformation. (The identity of these PTPs is not clearly established yet. A discussion of candidates will be added in the near future.)<p>The dephosphorylation of the receptor is also a signal for the receptor to recycle back to the plasma membrane.	protein tyrosine phosphatase;INSR

2012	8	translocation	TRAF3 is a ubiquitin ligase recruited to both MYD88- and TRIF-assembled signalling complexes [Hacker H et al 2006]. However, TRAF3 controls the production of interferon and proinflammatory cytokines in different ways [Tseng PH et al 2010]. Positive or negative type of regulation is dictated by TRAF3 subcellular distribution and its mode of ubiquitination. Thus, TRIF-mediated signaling initiated on endosomes triggers TRAF3 self-ubiquitination through noncanonical (K63-linked) polyubiquitination, which is essential for activation of IRF3/7 and the interferon response. In contrast, during MyD88-dependent signaling initiated from plasma membrane TRAF3 functions as a negative regulator of inflammatory cytokines and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), unless it undergoes degradative (K48-linked) polyubiquitination mediated by TRAF6 and a pair of the ubiquitin ligases cIAP1 and cIAP2.

2012	8	translocation	Rac1 exists in inactive state in the cytosol until the reception of extracellular signals by the cell. To be functional Rac1 is rapidly targeted to the plasma membrane upon cell stimulation. The main factors involved in this mobilisation are the Rac GEFs like VAV and phospholipids (PtdIns(4,5)P2, PtdIns(3,4,5) P3) and lipid rafts at the plasma membrane. VAV catalyses the disassociation of GDP from Rac1 by modifying the nucleotide-binding site such that GDP is released and subsequently replaced. The incoming GTP occupies the nucleotide binding site and finally displaces VAV from Rac1 (Bos et al. 2007, Bustelo et al. 2012).	PIP3__p-VAV family;RAC1

CFL1 is a member of the ADF (actin-depolymerizing factor) protein family that is involved in regulating actin dynamics in the growth cone. It binds to actin in a one-to-one molar ratio, and stimulates both the severing of actin filaments and depolymerization of actin subunits from the actin filament end. Activated LIMK phosphorylates CFL1 on the conserved serine 3 residue located near the actin-binding site. After phosphorylation, CFL1 is inactive, loses its affinity for actin and dissociates from G-actin monomers. Once freed, ADP-actin monomers can exchange ADP with cytoplasmic ATP, ready for reincorporation at the barbed end of a growing filament (Gungabissoon & Bamburg 2003).	LIMK1__Sema3a__Nrp1__PLXNA1;Cfl1

In yeast, the VCP homologue Cdc48 is associated with two additional proteins Ufd1 and Npl4 -both of which are also conserved in mammals- and this complex interacts with several ER components including derlins and the yeast SYVN1 homologue, Hrd1 (reviewed in Vembar and Brodsky, 2009). Consistent with the yeast data, VCP interacts with DERL2 by co-immunoprecipitation in HEK293 cells (Huang et al, 2013).	ub C-terminal Hh fragments__OS9/ERLEC1;SHH

Gt is a heterotrimer of alpha1 (GNAT1) (van Dop et al. 1989, Fong 1992), beta1 (GNB1) (Codina et al. 1986) and gamma1 (GNGT1) (Tao et al. 1993) subunits. Photoactivated rhodopsin (MII or R*) catalyzes the exchange of GTP for GDP bound to Gt. Upon GTP/GDP exchange, Gt is released from MII and the Gt alpha with GTP bound (GNAT1 GTP) dissociates from Gt beta gamma subunits (GNB1:GNGT1). This mechanism was deciphered from bovine experiments (Pugh & Lamb 1993). MII proceeds to activate additional Gt molecules, making this reaction the first amplification step in the phototransduction cascade. A single activated rhodopsin molecule activates tens of Gt molecules. Although phosphorylation of activated rhodopsin (MII) by rhodopsin kinase (GRK1) reduces transducin activation (Khani et al. 1996), complete deactivation occurs only after arrestin (S-antigen or SAG, Yamaki et al. 1988) binds to and sterically caps MII.<br><br>Defects in GNAT1 cause the Nougaret type of autosomal dominant, congenital stationary night blindness (Dryja et al. 1996, CSNBAD3; MIM:610444) .

2012	8	translocation	E-cadherin (CDH1) localizes to the lateral membrane of differentiated epithelia, providing the structural foundation for adherens junctions, multiprotein complexes that link cell-cell contacts to the actin cytoskeleton and various signaling molecules (Perez-Moreno et al. 2003, Baum & Georgiou 2011). The extracellular domain has five cadherin-type repeat ectodomain (EC) modules; the most membrane-distal EC mediates binding with CDH1 on adjacent cells (Boggon et al. 2002). Calcium ions bind between the EC domains of two CDH1 peptides to form a dimer with a rod-like conformation (Boggon et al. 2002) which is required for cell-cell interaction (Gumbiner 1996, Patel et al. 2006). The cytoplasmic tail of E-cadherin binds to the armadillo repeat protein beta-catenin, a target of the Wnt signaling pathway and a cofactor for TCF/LEF-mediated transcription (Gavard & Mège 2005). Beta-catenin in turn binds alpha-catenin, which interacts with the actin microfilament network, actin and the actin-binding proteins vinculin, formins, alpha-actinin, zonula occludin protein, and afadin (Bershadsky 2004). Cellcell adhesions also contain desmosomes, which link cell contacts to intermediate filaments, and nectin-based, calcium-independent adhesions, which are linked to actin (Takai & Nakanishi 2003, Yin and Green 2004). The critical importance of E-cadherin to normal development and tissue function is demonstrated by embryonic lethal E-cadherin gene mouse knockouts (Larue et al. 1994). Loss of cadherin-based cell-cell adhesion is a hallmark of carcinogenesis, correlating with tumour progression, allowing cells to escape normal growth control signals, resulting in loss of differentiation and increased cell proliferation associated with invasive behaviour (Frixen et al. 1991, Capaldo & Macara 2007). Full-length 120-kDa CDH1 protein is cleaved in the ectodomain close to the plasma membrane by a number of metalloproteases, generating an extracellular 38-kDa C-terminal fragment (CTF) termed CTF1 which can be further processed by a gamma-secretase-like activity to a soluble 33-kDa CTF2 (Marambaud et al. 2002, Roy & Berx 2008). MMP3, MMP7 (Noë et al. 2001, canine MMPs), MMP9 (Symowicz et al. 2007), plasmin (Ryniers et al. 2002, canine plasmin), Kallikrien 7 (Johnson et al. 2007), ADAM10 (Maretzky et al. 2005) and ADAM15 (Najy et al. 2008) all cleave CDH1 extracellularly, close to the transmembrane region. Presenilin-1 (Marambaud et al. 2002), the catalytic subunit of gamma-secretase (Herreman et al. 2003, Li et al. 2003), cleaves CDH1 producing a soluble 33-kDa fragment termed CTF2. Other enzymes like caspase-3 (Steinhusen et al. 2001) and calpain-1 (Rios-Doria et al. 2003) cleave E-cadherin in its cytoplasmic part releasing an intracellular 37 kDa c-terminal fragment.

Since Plx1-dependent Cdc25C phosphorylation occurs in the absence of Cdc2 activity, it is likely that Plx1 is a triggering kinase, which leads to the activation of Cdc2 and therefore the normal onset of mitosis. In addition to catalytically activating CDC25C, PLK1-mediated phosphorylation also results in the nuclear accumulation of CDC25C (Toyoshima-Morimoto et al. 2002).	PLK1;MPIP3

A Ca2+ dependent opsin phosphatase is also present (Kutuzov & Bennett 1996). Serine/threonine protein phosphatases with EF hands (PPEF1 and 2) that share homology with Drosophila retinal degeneration C (rdgC) are expressed in retina and may be responsible (Huang & Honkanen 1998), there is no evidence for a physiological role in dephosphorylating rhodopsin. Once dephosphorylated, RHO can once again bind the chromophore 11 cis retinal (11cRAL), in readiness for the next photon response.

2012	8	adds_modification	Activated rhodopsin (MII aka R*) must be deactivated to terminate the single photon response. Deactivation begins during the rising phase of the single photon response after MII binds rhodopsin kinase (GRK1), a serine/threonine protein kinase (Khani et al. 1996). GRK1 is activated by MII whereupon it phosphorylates MII at multiple serine and threonine sites on its C terminus. There are six serine and threonine residues that can be phosphorylated. Increasing phosphorylation progressively reduces the rate at which MII can activate transducin but full quenching requires the binding of arrestin (S-antigen or SAG, Yamaki et al. 1988) which binds to and sterically caps MII (Burns & Pugh 2010, Korenbrot 2012).<br><br>A substantial fraction of rhodopsin kinase (GRK1) is bound to recoverin (RCVRN) in darkness, when internal Ca2+ levels are high. RCVRN is an EF-hand protein (Murakami et al. 1992) that functions as a myristoyl switch. With Ca2+ bound, the myristoyl group is exposed to attach RCVRN to the membrane. When Ca2+ levels drop with light exposure, Ca2+ dissociates from RCVRN and GRK1 is released. Higher levels of free GRK1 accelerate the phosphorylation and shutoff of photoexcited rhodopsin (MII).<br><br>Certain mutations in GRK1 cause Oguchi type 2 disease, a rare, recessive form of congenital stationary night blindness (https://sph.uth.edu/retnet/).

This is thought to promote translocation of E2F4 and E2F5, which lack nuclear localization signals, to the cytosol, allowing activating E2Fs (E2F1, E2F2 and E2F3) to bind E2F promoters and activate transcription of genes needed for G1 progression.	p21/p27__Cyclin D__phospho-CDK4/6;RBL2

Mutagenesis studies highlight the importance of tyrosine residue 724 in signaling mediated by FGFR3, including transformation, SHP2 phosphorylation, and activation of MAPK, PI3K and STAT pathways. These studies also identified a role for the PLCgamma-binding tyrosine residue, Y760, in STAT activation, and a potential role for tyrosine 770 as a negative regulator of FGFR3 signaling.

2013	8	translocation	Membrane-bound sphingosine (SPG) in cells attenuates basal Ras activity by stimulating the activity of Ras GTPase-activating proteins (RasGAPs). Upon its phosphorylation by SPHK1, SPG is converted to sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) which then displaces from GAP downregulating RASA1 (p120GAP) activity and thereby induces Ras-GTP accumulation. This overall increases the level of activated Ras-GTP leading to activation of the ERK/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and cell division (Shu et al. 2002, Wu et al. 2003, Spiegel & Milstien 2006).	p-S225-SPHK1;RASA1

The covalent bond between opsin and its 11-cis-retinyl (11c-retinyl) ligand, which is unique among G protein coupled receptors, helps to confer extraordinary stability in darkness (Baylor et al. 1984). 11cRAL is an inverse agonist, that quenches the weak ability of opsin to activate transducin G protein (Gt). Upon photon absorption, the bound 11c-retinyl group isomerizes in a few hundred femtoseconds (Schoenlein et al. 1991) and with a high quantum efficiency of 0.7 (Dartnall 1968) to the bound all-trans-retinyl (at-retinyl) isomer. Then in the next few milliseconds, opsin undergoes a rearrangement in structure that renders it catalytically active (MII aka metarhodopsin II or R*) (Emeis et al. 1982).

2010	8	adds_modification	A series of sequential phosphorylation events lead to full or hyper-phopshorylation of IRAK1. Under in vitro conditions these are all autophosphorylation events. First, Thr-209 is phosphorylated resulting in a conformational change of the kinase domain. Next, Thr-387 in the activation loop is phosphorylated, leading to full enzymatic activity. Several additional residues are phosphorylated in the proline-, serine-, and threonine-rich (ProST) region between the N-terminal death domain and kinase domain. Hyperphosphorylation of this region leads to dissociation of IRAK1 from the upstream adapters MyD88 and Tollip. The significance of these phosphorylation events is not clear; the kinase activity of IRAK1 is dispensable for IL1-induced NFkB and MAP kinase activation (Knop & Martin, 1999), unlike that of IRAK4 (Suzuki et al. 2002; Kozicak-Holbro et al. 2007), so IRAK1 is believed to act primarily as an adaptor for TRAF6 (Conze et al. 2008).	p-T209,387-IRAK1;IRAK1
2010	8	adds_modification	Pro-interleukin-1 beta (pro-IL1B) is the primary substrate of caspase-1. IL1B production and processing is stimulated when pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) such as bacterial LPS are detected by cells of the innate immune system, and in response to pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF. Detection of PAMPs by Toll receptors leads to rapid IL1 transcription/translation and subsequent processing by caspase-1 in macrophages and monocytes. Processing is triggered by the activation of members of the NLR family and their associated inflammasome complexes. IL1B lacks a signal peptide to direct it to the Golgi for subsequent secretion, so the mode of secretion is uncertain. Once secreted, IL1B binds membrane-bound IL1 receptors, followed by recruitment of the IL1 receptor accessory protein to form a high affinity receptor complex. Ligand induced receptor activation induces the intracellular association of a number of cytosolic adapter proteins triggering intracellular signal transduction. This series of steps facilitates the induction of nuclear factor-kappa B (NFkB) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activity, leading to downstream transcription of additional inflammatory cytokines, including IL1B itself. A calpain-like potease has been reported to be important for the processing of pro- IL1A, but much less is known about how IL1A is released from cells and what specific roles it plays in biology.

ERK is thought to play at least two roles in RSK1 activation.

2010	8	adds_modification	Similar models explain JAK activation by the cytokine-like hormone receptors (GHR and PRLR) and interleukin receptors. JAK2 activation is believed to occur as mutual transactivation whereby JAK2 bound to one receptor chain phosphorylates JAK2 bound to the other receptor chain in the dimeric receptor. Transactivation is widely accepted (Herrington & Carter-Su 2001) having been originally proposed in the 1990's (Quelle et al. 1994, Hou et al. 2002). JAK phosphorylation is thought to lock the kinase domain in an active state; prior to this JAK2 is held in an inactive state by interactions between its kinase and pseudokinase domains (Giordanetto & Kroemer 2002). Although there are structures of JAK kinase domains (e.g. Lucet et al. 2006), no complete JAK structures are available and the activation mechanism remains poorly understood (Brooks & Waters 2010). The trigger for JAK activation is believed to be a conformational change in the receptor when ligand is bound, leading to a rotation of the cytoplasmic regions which brings the catalytic domains of bound JAK2 molecules into close proximity and frees them from inhibition by the pseudokinase domains. Supporting observations for cytokine-like hormone receptors include: JAK2 becomes tyrosine phosphorylated as a consequence of GHR activation by GH (Argetsinger et al. 1993); JAK2 is activated following PRLR activation (Campbell et al. 1994, Rui et al. 1994); forced dimerization of GH receptor domains is sufficient to activate signaling (Behncken et al. 2000); phosphorylation of JAK2 at Y1007 is critical for kinase activation (Feng et al. 1997, Lucet et al. 2006); JAK autophosphorylation at several other sites appears to regulate activity (e.g. Feener et al. 2004, Argetsinger et al. 2004, 2010). Only the Y1007 phosphorylation is represented in this reaction.	SH2B1-2;JAK2

This phosphorylation disables the KI-domain-kinase interaction and thereby reduces the affinity of the PAK dimers.<br>Its been demonstarted that L1 stimulation propagates through VAV2-Rac1-Pak1 to MEK-ERK.

2013	8	adds_modification	Following VEGF treatment, VAV2 phosphorylation on tyrosine 172 stimulates its GEF activity for RAC1 (Garrett et al. 2007) and thus plays an important role in linking VEGFR2 to endothelial migration. VAV exists in an auto-inhibitory state, folded in such a way as to inhibit the GEF activity of its DH domain. This folding is mediated through binding of tyrosines in the acidic domain to the DH domain and through binding of the calponin homology (CH) domain to the C1 region. Activation of VAV is thought to involve three events which relieve this auto-inhibition: phosphorylation of tyrosines in the acidic domain causes them to be displaced from the DH domain; binding of a ligand to the CH domain may cause it to release the C1 domain; binding of the PI3K product PIP3 to the PH domain may alter its conformation (Aghazadeh et al. 2000). VAV is phosphorylated on a tyrosine residue (Y174 in VAV1, 172 in VAV2, 173 in VAV3) in the acidic domain. This is mediated by Src and related family tyrosine kinases (Deckert et al. 1996, Schuebel et al. 1998).	SRC1;VAV3

2009	8	adds_modification	The EPHB2-FAK pathway partially promotes dendritic spine stability through LIMK-mediated cofilin (CFL1) phosphorylation (Shi et al. 2009). CFL1 is a member of the ADF (actin-depolymerizing factor) protein family that is involved in regulating actin dynamics in the growth cone. It binds to actin in a one-to-one molar ratio, and stimulates both the severing of actin filaments and depolymerization of actin subunits from the actin filament end. Activated LIMK phosphorylates CFL1 on the conserved serine 3 residue located near the actin-binding site. After phosphorylation, CFL1 is inactive, loses its affinity for actin and dissociates from G-actin monomers. Once freed, ADP-actin monomers can exchange ADP with cytoplasmic ATP, ready for reincorporation at the barbed end of a growing filament (Gungabissoon & Bamburg 2003).	p-S,T508-LIMK1;COF1

The details of the docking and priming reaction have been worked out using synaptic vesicles loaded with glutamate and similar reactions may occur during the transport cycle of acetylcholine. The vesicle is held in close apposition to the plasma membrane by several proteins that bridge the synaptic vesicle to the plasma membrane. Some of these proteins are in the plasma membrane while others are in the synaptic vesicle. Vesicle fusion is preceded by a priming event where molecular interactions between the docked vesicle and the plasma membrane undergo changes. The molecules in the docking and the priming process are known, however, the exact sequence and the precise molecular changes involved in docking and priming are not well dissected. In this reaction the process of docking and priming has been condensed. It is known that Munc18 along with its interactors is critical for membrane docking and fusion events while Munc 13 along with its interacting proteins is central to priming. Munc 13 could act as a positive regulator for the priming recation. Finally the primed fusion complex is clamped in the pre-fusion form by a Complexin.

2006	8	adds_modification	Chk1 is a checkpoint kinase activated during genotoxic stress. Like ATR, Chk1 is essential for viability in mammals. Targeted gene disruption in mice shows that loss of Chk1 causes peri-implantation embryonic lethality. Even though ATR-ATRIP not bound to ssDNA can phosphorylate Chk1, Chk1 activation is greatly enhanced when recruited to stalled replication forks by physical interaction with a modified form of claspin and the Rad9-Hus1-Rad1 sliding clamp. Activation of Chk1 occurs following phosphorylation of two sites (serine 317 and serine 345). Mutational analysis indicates that modification of both sites is essential for maximal kinase activity, while phosphorylation of only a single site causes only weak activation of Chk1. Following phosphorylation, Chk1 can diffuse away from the complex to further amplify the checkpoint signal. ATR appears to be the primary kinase activating Chk1 as conditions that activate ATR (ultraviolet irradiation or treatment with hydroxyurea) also activate Chk1. Stresses that activate ATM, e.g., ionizing irradiation, do not cause significant Chk1 activation. While the ATR and ATM pathways are distinct, there is interplay between the two. For example, double-strand DNA breaks can be processed in an ATM-dependent manner to generate structures that can cause ATR and hence Chk1 activation. The ATR and ATM pathways also have mechanistic similarities. Analogous to the Chk1 kinase existing downstream of ATR, the Chk2 checkpoint kinase is modified and activated by ATM. Although having distinct structures, Chk1 and Chk2 also have overlapping targets with some substrate sites phosphorylatable by both kinases (e.g., serine 20 of p53).	ATRIP__ATR;CHK1
2006	8	adds_modification	Claspin is a replication fork-associated protein important for Chk1 activation. Claspin loads onto the fork during replication origin firing and travels with the fork during DNA synthesis. Upon fork uncoupling and ATR-ATRIP binding to persistent ssDNA, the activated ATR kinase phosphorylates claspin at two primary sites. Modification increases the affinity of claspin for Chk1. Studies of human or Xenopus claspin indicate that phosphorylation of both sites is essential for significant claspin-Chk1 association. Following claspin modification by ATR, Chk1 can be transiently recruited to the stalled replication fork for subsequent phosphorylation and activation by ATR. Activation of Chk1 allows modification of additional downstream targets, thus amplifying the checkpoint signal. While much of the mechanistic information concerning claspin action has been obtained using Xenopus laevis egg extracts and Xenopus claspin, factors with similar activity have been found in various eukaryotic species including S. cerevisiae (MRC1), S. pombe (mrc1), and humans.<p>Activated ATR phosphorylates human claspin on two sites, threonine 916 and serine 945.

LEs/lysosomes with peptide loaded MHC II molecules may move in a bidirectional manner in a stop-and-go fashion along microtubules to the plasma membrane, driven by the activities of the oppositely-directed motor proteins dynein and kinesin (Wubbolts et al. 1996, 1999, Chow et al. 2002, Rocha & Neefjes 2007). Ultimately, LEs/lysosomes fuse to the plasma membrane delivering the MHC II-peptide complexes to the surface (Raposo et al. 1996, Rocha & Neefjes 2007). RAB7-GTP present on LEs/lysosome membrane interacts with Rab7-interacting lysosomal protein (RILP) and oxysterol-binding protein-related protein 1L (ORP1L) to form a tripartite RILP-Rab7-ORP1L complex. RILP binds to the p150 dynactin subunit to recruit the dynein or kinesin motor proteins. ORP1L recruits this complex to betaIII spectrin domains, which appears to be critical for dynein motor activation and transport of LEs/lysosome vesicles to the cell periphery (Johansson et al. 2007, Rocha & Neefjes 2008).

2005	8	translocation	The <b><i>Protonmotive Q cycle</i></b> is the mechanism by which complex III transfers electrons from ubiquinol to cytochrome c, linking this process to translocation of protons across the membrane. This cycle is complicated by the fact that both ubiquinol is oxidised and ubiquinone is reduced during this process.

2009	8	adds_modification	Stimulation of platelets with collagen-related peptide leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of SLP-76, an adaptor protein with multiple binding domains (Gross et al. 1999). This may be mediated by Syk , analogous to the role of ZAP-70 in phosphorylating T-cell SLP-76 (Bubeck-Wardenberg et al. 1996). The phosphorylated tyrosine residues provide a binding site for the SH2 domains of downstream signalling proteins like Vav, Itk and ADAP (Jordan et al. 2003). Platelets from mice defective in SLP76 do not connect GPVI engagement with downstream signaling (Clements et al. 1999, Judd et al. 2000). GPVI signaling via SLP-76 does not appear to require LAT or GADS (Judd et al. 2002) suggesting that the mechanism is not identical to that of T-cells. LAT and SLP-76 are both required for P-selectin expression and degranulation but may function independently, or rely on proteins not required by T-cells (Jordan et al. 2003).	SYK;LCP2

2009	8	adds_modification	SLP-76 has a well-established role in recruitment of PLC gamma 1 in immunoreceptor signalling; its role in the recruitment of PLC gamma 2 in integrin signalling is less clear. Results from SLP-76 null mice imply a functional role in GPVI signalling. Platelets from SLP-76 null mice exhibit a marked reduction in spreading and a decrease in whole cell phosphotyrosine levels when adhered to a fibrinogen-coated surface. In vivo reconstitution of SLP-76 by retroviral gene transfer corrects bleeding diathesis and restores normal responses to both collagen and fibrinogen (Judd et al., 2000).	p-SLP-76;PLCG2

A Ca2+ dependent opsin phosphatase is also present (Kutuzov & Bennett 1996). Serine/threonine protein phosphatases with EF hands (PPEF1 and 2) that share homology with Drosophila retinal degeneration C (rdgC) are expressed in retina and may be responsible (Huang & Honkanen 1998), there is no evidence for a physiological role in dephosphorylating rhodopsin. Once dephosphorylated, RHO can once again bind the chromophore 11 cis retinal (11cRAL), in readiness for the next photon response.

2012	8	adds_modification	Activated rhodopsin (MII aka R*) must be deactivated to terminate the single photon response. Deactivation begins during the rising phase of the single photon response after MII binds rhodopsin kinase (GRK1), a serine/threonine protein kinase (Khani et al. 1996). GRK1 is activated by MII whereupon it phosphorylates MII at multiple serine and threonine sites on its C terminus. There are six serine and threonine residues that can be phosphorylated. Increasing phosphorylation progressively reduces the rate at which MII can activate transducin but full quenching requires the binding of arrestin (S-antigen or SAG, Yamaki et al. 1988) which binds to and sterically caps MII (Burns & Pugh 2010, Korenbrot 2012).<br><br>A substantial fraction of rhodopsin kinase (GRK1) is bound to recoverin (RCVRN) in darkness, when internal Ca2+ levels are high. RCVRN is an EF-hand protein (Murakami et al. 1992) that functions as a myristoyl switch. With Ca2+ bound, the myristoyl group is exposed to attach RCVRN to the membrane. When Ca2+ levels drop with light exposure, Ca2+ dissociates from RCVRN and GRK1 is released. Higher levels of free GRK1 accelerate the phosphorylation and shutoff of photoexcited rhodopsin (MII).<br><br>Certain mutations in GRK1 cause Oguchi type 2 disease, a rare, recessive form of congenital stationary night blindness (https://sph.uth.edu/retnet/).

2008	8	translocation	Once vesicles are docked, primed and ready to be released fusion of the synaptic vesicle with the plasma membrane can be triggered by an influx of Ca2+ through the voltage gated Ca2+ channels (N, P/Q and R type). Ca2+ influx initiates a cascade of events in which the Ca2+ sensing protein, synaptotagmin-1 (sty-1) is central. Sty-1 promotes the membrane fusion between the synaptic vesicle and the plasma membrane by Ca2+ dependant induction of membrane curvature. Synaptotagmin competes with SNARE complex binding in a Ca2+ dependent manner thereby displacing complexin-1 and causing membrane curvature and fusion of the synaptic vesicle with the plasma membrane. The fusion is characterized by the formation of a trans SNARE complex in which SNAP 25, syntaxin and synaptobrevin along with VGLUT1, the glutamate transporter, synaptotagmin, and Rab3a either become a part of the plasma membrane or membrane delimited in the vesicular membrane.

A Ca2+ dependent opsin phosphatase is also present (Kutuzov & Bennett 1996). Serine/threonine protein phosphatases with EF hands (PPEF1 and 2) that share homology with Drosophila retinal degeneration C (rdgC) are expressed in retina and may be responsible (Huang & Honkanen 1998), there is no evidence for a physiological role in dephosphorylating rhodopsin. Once dephosphorylated, RHO can once again bind the chromophore 11 cis retinal (11cRAL), in readiness for the next photon response. Arrestin (S-antigen or SAG, Yamaki et al. 1988) binds to and sterically caps MII, preventing PPEF1 from dephosphorylating it.

2012	8	adds_modification	Activated rhodopsin (MII aka R*) must be deactivated to terminate the single photon response. Deactivation begins during the rising phase of the single photon response after MII binds rhodopsin kinase (GRK1), a serine/threonine protein kinase (Khani et al. 1996). GRK1 is activated by MII whereupon it phosphorylates MII at multiple serine and threonine sites on its C terminus. There are six serine and threonine residues that can be phosphorylated. Increasing phosphorylation progressively reduces the rate at which MII can activate transducin but full quenching requires the binding of arrestin (S-antigen or SAG, Yamaki et al. 1988) which binds to and sterically caps MII (Burns & Pugh 2010, Korenbrot 2012).<br><br>A substantial fraction of rhodopsin kinase (GRK1) is bound to recoverin (RCVRN) in darkness, when internal Ca2+ levels are high. RCVRN is an EF-hand protein (Murakami et al. 1992) that functions as a myristoyl switch. With Ca2+ bound, the myristoyl group is exposed to attach RCVRN to the membrane. When Ca2+ levels drop with light exposure, Ca2+ dissociates from RCVRN and GRK1 is released. Higher levels of free GRK1 accelerate the phosphorylation and shutoff of photoexcited rhodopsin (MII).<br><br>Certain mutations in GRK1 cause Oguchi type 2 disease, a rare, recessive form of congenital stationary night blindness (https://sph.uth.edu/retnet/).

2011	8	binds	Soluble antigens are presented to dendritic cells (DCs) in some cases by receptor mediated endocytosis or fluid-phase endocytosis. Burgdorf et al. (2008) suggest that there are two different endocytic compartments for antigen processing: one dedicated to MHC class I (early endosomes) and the other one for MHC class II presentation (lysosomes). Sorting of cargo into these different compartments occurs at the plasma membrane and is likely to depend on the type of endocytic receptor the cargo is interacting with (Burgdorf et al. 2008, Zhuang et al. 2006). The mannose receptor (MR) is the best studied receptor that targets soluble antigens to early endosomes but not to lysosomes (Burgdorf et al. 2006). Antigens taken up by the MR are targeted towards a mildly acidic stable early endosomal compartment for exclusive presentation on MHC I molecules (Burgdorf et al. 2008).

2006	8	binds	p75NTR exists in a multimeric form both in presence or absence of NGF. In the NGF:p75NTR complex, a single p75 molecule is asymmetrically bound to a NGF homodimer, along the homodimeric interface of NGF. This causes an allosteric conformational change, which disables the NGF symmetry-related second p75 binding site. Therefore, it is possible that NGF has to perturb or alter the preformed p75 dimer orientation in order to initiate intracellular signalling. NGF:p75NTR complexes are not so long living as the NGF:TRKA complexes. This is due, at least in part, to the fact that TRKA homodimers are internalized, and continue signalling in endosomes.<br>Contrary to what is commonly believed, NGF bind to p75NTR and TRKA, individually, with a similar equilibrium binding constant (Kd ~ 1-2 nM). As a matter of fact, the association constant for NGF binding to p75NTR (k+1 = 8x10 to power of 6 M-1 s-1) is faster than for TRKA (k+1 = 8x10 to power of 5 M-1 s-1). On the other hand, the off rate of the NGF:TRKA complex ( k-1 = 7.2x10 to power of -5 s-1) is much slower than the NGF:p75NTR complex (k-1 = 1x10 to power of -3 s-1) . p75NTR and TRK receptors functionally interact, but the precise means by which this occurs has remained unresolved. This could result from a direct physical interaction or be explained by convergent signalling of these two receptors. Co-expression of both p75NTR and TRKA at the cell surface appears to result in the formation of a âhigh-affinityâ binding site that has an accelerated rate of NGF association and a 30- to 100-fold higher affinity for NGF (Kd ~ 1-3 x 10 to power of -11 M) than either receptor alone.<br>The high-affinity binding sites appear to constitute 10%â15% of the total NGF binding sites. The nature of such high affinity binding sites is still unclear. They could be due to a multimeric complex of p75:TRKA proteins. Alternatively, NGF might first rapidly bind to p75NTR and then be presented to TRKA in a conformation that lowers its TRKA association rate. Some authors even question the existence of these high affinity sites. Structural data on NGF complexes with p75NTR and TRKA extracellular domains suggest that formation of a ternary complex TRKA:NGF:p75NTR in a 1:2:1 ration is theoretically possible, although unlikely. However, biochemical data so far failed to show that this complex forms.	NGF;NGFR

2008	8	binds	Phosphorylation of the ITAMs by Lck is followed by the recruitment of the ZAP-70 a member of Syk family PTK, to the receptor complex. ZAP-70 is exclusively expressed in T cells and NK cells. The dually phosphorylated ITAMs provide a high-affinity docking site for the tandem SH2-domains of the ZAP-70. Once recruited, ZAP-70 is activated by phosphorylation and will be responsible for the phosphorylation of further downstream molecules. Due to the presence of 10 ITAMs in the TCR complex, up to 10 ZAP-70 molecules may cluster on the fully phosphorylated receptors.	p-Y394-LCK__CD4;ZAP70

2007	8	binds	As influenza viruses bud from the plasma membrane of infected cells, complete virions are not seen inside cells. In polarized epithelial cells, assembly and budding of influenza occurs from the apical plasma membrane (Schmitt, 2004). For efficient assembly, all virion components must accumulate at the budding site, and it is believed that the viral glycoprotein accumulation determines the site of virus assembly and budding (Nayak, 2004). M1 is thought to be the bridge between the envelope glycoproteins and the RNPs for assembly (Schmitt, 2004). M2 is also required, because if it is not present RNPs are not packaged into budding virions (McCown, 2005), however it role is not known.	NEP/NS2;M1

2005	8	binds	Glucagon (Thomsen J et al, 1972) is an important peptide hormone produced by the pancreas. It is released when the glucose level in the blood is low (hypoglycemia), causing the liver to convert stored glycogen into glucose and release it into the bloodstream. The action of glucagon is thus opposite to that of insulin. Glucagon, together with glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and glucagon-like peptide 2 (GLP-2), are peptide hormones encoded by a single common prohormone precursor, proglucagon.The glucagon receptor (Lok S et al, 1994) plays a central role in regulating the level of blood glucose by controlling the rate of hepatic glucose production and insulin secretion. The activity of this receptor is mediated by coupling to Gs and q, which stimulate adenylyl cyclase and a phosphatidylinositol-calcium second messenger system respectively.	Glucagon;GCGR

2006	8	binds	The Rad17-RFC complex is involved in an early stage of the genotoxic stress response. The major function of the protein complex is to load the Rad9-Hus1-Rad1 (9-1-1) complex onto DNA at sites of damage and/or stalled replication forks. This reaction is conceptually similar to the loading of the PCNA sliding clamp onto DNA by RFC. The association of the Rad17-RFC complex with ssDNA or gapped or primed DNA is significantly stimulated by RPA, but not by the heterologous E. coli SSB. Loading of the human 9-1-1 complex onto such DNA templates is also strongly stimulated by cognate RPA, but not yeast RPA. Although Rad17 and Rad9 are substrates of the ATR kinase activity, loading of the Rad17 and 9-1-1 complexes onto DNA occurs independent of ATR.<p>The Rad17-RFC complex is a heteropentamer structurally similar to RFC. The complex contains the four smaller RFC subunits (Rfc2 [p37], Rfc3 [p36], Rfc4 [p40], and Rfc5 [p38]) and the 75 kDa Rad17 subunit in place of the Rfc1 [p140] subunit. The Rad17 complex contains a weak ATPase that is slightly stimulated by primed DNA. Along with binding the 9-1-1 complex and RPA, the Rad17-RFC complex interacts with human MCM7 protein. Each of these interactions is critical for Chk1 activation.<p>The Rad17 subunit is conserved evolutionarily with the protein showing 49% identity at the amino acid level with the S. pombe rad17 protein. Targeted deletion of the N-terminal region of mouse Rad17 leads to embryonic lethality, strongly suggesting that human Rad17 is also essential for long-term viability.<p>Rad17-RFC complex associates with DNA substrates containing ssDNA regions including gapped or primed DNA in an ATP-independent reaction. Loading of the Rad9-Hus1-Rad1 (9-1-1) complex occurs preferentially on DNA substrates containing a 5' recessed end. This contrasts with the loading of PCNA by RFC which preferentially occurs on DNA with 3' recessed ends.	Persistent single-stranded DNA;RFC4__RAD17__RFC2__RFC5__RFC3

2004	8	binds	The active form of G protein alpha subunit q (Gq-alpha) was found to activate phospholipase C beta-1 (PLC-beta1), in investigations using bovine membranes. Subsequently, all 4 human isoforms have been shown to be activated by Gq, though activation of PLCbeta-4 is limited. In recombinant assays, several activated rat G alpha q family members were found to stimulate human PLC-beta isoforms with the same rank order of decreasing potency. PLC-beta1 stimulation was slightly more than for PLC-beta3; PLC-beta3 stimulation was 10-fold greater than for beta-2. PLC-beta2 is expressed specifically in hematopoietic cells. PLC-beta acts directly on Gq to accelerate hydrolysis of bound GTP, thus PLC-betas are GTPase activating proteins (GAPs). The crystal structure of the C-terminal region from Turkey PLC-beta, revealed a novel fold composed almost entirely of three long helices forming a coiled-coil that dimerizes along its long axis in an antiparallel orientation. The extent of the dimer interface and gel exclusion chromatography data suggest that PLC-betas are functionally dimeric.	PLCB2__PLCB1__PLCB3__PLCB4;G-protein alpha (i/o/z/t) subunit__GTP

2008	8	binds	<b>THE NUCLEAR RECEPTOR-MED1 REACTION</b>: The Nuclear Receptor (NR) proteins are a highly conserved family of DNA-binding transcription factors that bind certain hormones, vitamins, and other small, diffusible signaling molecules. The non-liganded NRs recruit specific corepressor complexes of the NCOR/SMRT type, to mediate transcriptional repression of the target genes to which they are bound. During signaling, ligand binding to a specific domain in the NR proteins induces a conformational change that results in the exchange of the associated corepressor complex, and its replacement by a specific coactivator complex of either the TRAP/DRIP/Mediator type, or the p160/SRC type. The Mediator coactivator complexes typically nucleate around the MED1 coactivator protein, which is directly bound to the NR transcription factor (reviewed in Freedman, 1999; Malik, 2005).<br><br> A general feature of the NR proteins is that they each contain a specific protein interaction domain (PID), or domains, that mediates the specific binding interactions with the MED1 proteins. In the ligand-bound state, NRs each take part in an NR-MED1 binding reaction to form an NR-MED1 complex. The bound MED1 then functions to nucleate the assembly of additional specific coactivator proteins, depending on the cell and DNA context, such as what specific target gene promoter or enhancer they are bound to, and in what cell type.<br><br> The formation of specific MED1-containing coactivator complexes on specific NR proteins has been well-characterized for a number of the human NR proteins. For example, binding of Vitamin D to the human Vitamin D3 Receptor was found to result in the recruitment of a specific complex of D Receptor Interacting Proteins - the DRIP coactivator complex (Rachez, 1998). Within the DRIP complex, the DRIP205 subunit was later renamed human "MED1", based on sequence similarities with yeast MED1 (reviewed in Bourbon, 2004).<br><br> Similarly, binding of thyroid hormone (TH) to the human TH Receptor (THRA or THRB) was found to result in the recruitment of a specific complex of Thyroid Receptor Associated Proteins - the TRAP coactivator complex (Yuan, 1998). The TRAP220 subunit was later identified to be the Mediator 1 (MED1) homologue (summarized in Bourbon, et al., 2004; Table 1).<br><br> The 48 human NR proteins each contain the PID(s) known to mediate interaction with the human MED1 protein. Direct NR-MED1 protein-protein interactions have been shown for a number of the NR proteins. The MED1-interacting PIDs are conserved in all of the human NRs. Therefore, each of the human NRs is known or expected to interact with MED1 in the appropriate cell context, depending on the cell type, the cell state, and the target gene regulatory region involved.

Other ELR-positive chemokines (CXCL1 to CXCL7) can also bind with CXCR2 to cause various effects as described below.<br>CXCL1 (previously known as GRO1 oncogene; NAP-3; MSGA-alpha) (Richmond A et al, 1988) is expressed by neutrophils, macrophages and epithelial cells and possesses neutrophil chemoattractant activity. It is secreted by melanoma cells and is implicated in melanoma pathogenesis. CXCL2 (MIP2-alpha;Gro-beta;Gro-2) (Iida N and Grotendorst GR, 1990; Haskill S et al, 1990) is closely related to CXCL1 (90% amino acid sequence). It is secreted by monocytes and macrophages and attracts polymorphonuclear leukocytes and hematopoietic stem cells. CXCL3 (GRO3; GROg; MIP2-beta) (Haskill S et al, 1990) controls the migration and adhesion of monocytes.<br>CXCL4 (platelet factor 4, PF4) (Poncz M et al, 1987) is released from platelets during aggregation and promotes blood coagulation by neutralization of heparin-like molecules. It is chemotactic for neutrophils, fibroblasts and monocytes. Due to all these roles, CXCL4 is implicated in wound repair and inflammation. CXCL5 (ENA-78) (Walz A et al, 1991) is produced by cells which have been stimulated by interleulin-1 or tumor necrosis factor-alpha. CXCL7 (pro-platelet basic protein, PPBP) (Holt JC et al, 1986) is released from platelets once they are activated. It can stimulate various processes including glucose metabolism, mitogenesis and syntheses of plasminogen activator and extracellular matrix.	CXCL3__PPBP__IL8__CXCL5__CXCL1__CXCL6__CXCL2;CXCR2

2013	8	binds	Cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP, thrombospondin-5) is a 524-kDa pentameric glycoprotein expressed primarily in cartilage, tendon, ligament and synovium. In adult cartilage, COMP is located primarily in the inter-territorial matrix between chondrocytes (Murphy et al. 1999). The mature protein is pentameric with each monomer linked to its neighbour by a disulphide bond, located at the amino terminus of the protein (Hedbom et al. 1992, Morgelin et al. 1992). COMP binds directly to collagen types I, II and IX (Rosenberg et al. 1998, Thur et al. 2001) at the fibril periphery. In addition it binds fibronectin (FN1) (Di Cesare et al. 2002), matrilins 1, 3 and 4 (Mann et al. 2004), and through the glycosaminoglycans heparan sulphate and chondroitin sulphate to aggrecan (Hauser et al. 1996, Chen et al. 2007).<br>Mutations in COMP lead to pseudoachondroplasia and multiple epiphyseal dysplasia (Jackson et al. 2012). COMP binding to FN1 and probably to other partners requires the presence of the divalent cations Ca2+, Mg2+ or Mn2+. Each COMP subunit binds approximately 10 calcium ions (Chen et al. 2000).

This interaction is essential for membrane recruitment of Vav1. Similarly, association of Vav3 with SLP-76 was found to be essential for membrane recruitment.

2008	8	binds	MyoD is a basic helix loop helix (bHLH) myoblast specific transcription factor defined as a 'master switch' gene in that it can convert other cell types into muscles if the gene is active in them. bHLH proteins Myf5, Myogenin and MRF4/Myf6 are highly related to MyoD and these along with MyoD form the 'MyoD family' of transcription factors, also called the myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs). <br>MRFs form transcriptionally active heterodimers with the widely expressed E proteins, a distinct group of bHLH proteins including E12/E47, ITF-2 and HEB. Dimerization of these proteins juxtaposes their basic domains forming a functional DNA binding domain. MyoD/E protein heterodimers preferentially bind the DNA consensus sequence referred to as an E-box (CANNTG) in the control regions of muscle-specific genes and activate gene transcription of genes that are expressed in skeletal muscle.

2011	8	binds	Mammalian cell lines were constructed that allow for independent modulation of the levels of cis- and trans-Delta and quantitative monitoring of the transcriptional response of a Noth reporter gene (Citrine fluorescent protein cDNA fused to a Notch responsive promoter). Cell lines stably expressed recombinant human NOTCH1 and contained a DNA encoding a doxycycline-inducible recombinant rat Dll1 (cis-Dll1). Cell lines were grown on plates containing different concentrations of adsorbed recombinant Dll1 (trans-Dll1). In the absence of cis-Dll1 (no doxycycline added), NOTCH1 activation is proportional to the concentration of trans-Delta. Induction of cis-Dll1 expression blocks NOTCH1 activation, and the response to cis-Dll1 is sharp and switch-like.	Dll1;NOTCH1(1665-2555)__NOTCH1 Extracellular fragment (NECD1)
2012	8	binds	DPP (also called phosphophoryn) is a highly acidic protein and is the major noncollagenous matrix component of dentin (13,,15). The molecule is so-called because it is considered to be a phosphate carrier (16). DPP is exceedingly rich in aspartic acid and serine residues ((DSS)n), and about 90% of the serine residues are phosphorylated (17, 18). This enables DPP to have a strong affinity for calcium ion, and thus it significantly promotes the growth of hydroxyapatite crystals when bound to collagen fibrils in vitro.	CD51 antigen__ITGB1;DSPP
2007	8	binds	Alpha5beta1 integrin was the first integrin shown to bind fibronectin (FN1). Unlike other FN1-binding integrins it is a specialist at this task. In solution FN1 occurs as a dimer. Binding to alpha5beta1 integrin stimulates FN1 self-association; blocking the RGD-cell binding domain of FN1 blocks fibril formation (Fogerty et al. 1990). FN1 binding is believed to induce integrin clustering, which promotes FN1-FN1 interactions. Integrin clustering is mediated by association between integrins and intracellular actin stress fibers (Calderwood et al. 2000). Binding of integrins to each of the monomers in the FN1 dimer pair is thought to trigger a conformational change in FN1 that exposes 'cryptic' FN1 binding sites that allow additional fibronectin dimers to bind without the requirement for pre-association with integrins (Singh et al. 2010). This non-covalent interaction may involve interactions with fibrillin (Ohashi & Erickson 2009). I1-5 functions as a unit that is the primary FN matrix assembly domain (Sottile et al. 1991) but other units are likely to be involved (Singh et al. 2010). Other integrins able to bind FN1 include alphaIIbBeta3, which is highly expressed on platelets where it predominantly binds fibrinogen leading to thrombus formation but also binds FN1 (Savage et al. 1996). Alpha4beta1 mediates cell-cell contacts and cell-matrix contacts through the ligands VCAM-1 and FN1, respectively (Humphries et al. 1995). Integrins alpha3beta1, alpha4beta7, alphaVbeta1, 3 (Johansson et al. 1997), 6 (Busk et al. 1992) and alpha8beta1 (Muller et al. 1995, Farias et al. 2005) are all able to bind FN1. <br><br>Tenacious binding of free fibronectin to cells leads to enhanced fibronectin matrix assembly and the formation of a polymerized fibronectin "cocoon" around the cells. This process is enhanced in the presence of CEACAM molecules.	FN;Mn2+

As is the case for FRS2alpha, binding of FRS2beta to FGFR may be constitutive and/or independent of receptor activation. Elements of the downstream signaling mediated by the two FRS2 family members appear to be at least partially conserved, as FRS2beta is phosphorylated upon FGF stimulation, binds SHP2 and GRB2 and results in ERK activation. Moreover, expression of FRS2beta in FRS2alpha-/- MEFs restores ERK activation.	FRS3;Activated FGFR2c homodimer bound to FGF__Activated FGFR2b homodimer bound to FGF
2013	8	binds	Signaling by WNT5A and FZD2 activates PDE6 through G protein alpha subunit t2 (Liu et al, 1999; Ahumada et al, 2002). The discovery that G alpha t2 is involved in WNT:Ca2+ signaling was surprising, as this G protein subunit is best characterized for its role in visual transduction and its expression in vertebrates is almost exclusively restricted to the visual pathway (reviewed in Wang et al, 2004). Recent work in the WNT field has shown that a pathway similar to the visual transduction cascade exists in the mouse F9 teratocarcinoma cell line, CHO cells, zebrafish embryos as well as in a number of human cancer cell lines (Liu et al, 1999; Ahumada et al, 2002; Bazhin et al, 2010). PDE6 is a tetramer of two catalytic subunits, alpha and beta, held in an inactive conformation by two regulatory gamma subunits. Recruitment and binding with G alpha t2 relaxes the inhibitory effect of PDE6gamma and allows activation of the catalytic subunits (reviewed in Wensel, 2008). Activation of PDE6 in the WNT pathway may also depend on p38 MAPK (Ma and Wang, 2007).	PDE6A__PDE6B__PDE6G;GTP__GNAT2
2006	8	binds	hTERC is transcribed as a precursor and is processed at its 3' end to yield a 451 nucleotide RNA (Zaug et al. 1996). The accumulation of hTERC that has undergone this processing event requires a conserved region of sequence termed the box H/ACA motif (Mitchell et al. 1999a). This motif is bound by a complex containing dyskerin, and mutations in dyskerin affect the processing and accumulation of hTERC (Mitchell et al. 1999b; Mitchell and Collins 2000; Fu and Collins 2003). Recent studies of purified, catalytically active telomerase indicate that the minimal structure that has telomerase activity in vitro is a complex of one molecule of hTERC RNA and two each of hTERT and DKC1 (dyskerin) proteins (Cohen et al. 2007). Several additional proteins may associate with this minimal complex and modulate its activity. RUVBL1 (pontin), RUVBL2 (reptin), and TCAB1 (telomere Cajal body protein 1) are found associated with human telomerase RNPs purified from HeLa cells, and activities of these proteins are required for telomerase RNP assembly in vivo (Venteicher et al. 2008, 2009). NHP2 (NOLA2) is likewise associated with telomerase ribonucleoprotein complexes (Pogacic et al. 2000) and homozygosity for NHP2 mutations is associated with telomerase failure (dyskeratosis congenita) in humans (Vuillamy et al. 2008).

An N-terminal fragment of CHD was independently identified as the rat protein Duplin. Duplin was shown to negatively regulate WNT target gene expression by competing with TCF7L2 for beta-catenin binding (Sakamoto et al, 2000; Kobayashi et al, 2002).

2008	8	binds	Docking and priming of clathrin sculpted acetylcholine loaded transport vesicle occurs once the synaptic vesicle has moved from the cytoplasm to a region apposed to the plasma membrane. The details of the docking and priming reaction have been worked out using synaptic vesicles loaded with glutamate and similar reactions may occur during the transport cycle of acetylcholine. The vesicle is held in close apposition to the plasma membrane by several proteins that bridge the synaptic vesicle to the plasma membrane. Some of these proteins are in the plasma membrane while others are in the synaptic vesicle. Vesicle fusion is preceded by a priming event where molecular interactions between the docked vesicle and the plasma membrane undergo changes. The molecules in the docking and the priming process are known, however, the exact sequence and the precise molecular changes involved in docking and priming are not well dissected. In this reaction the process of docking and priming has been condensed. It is known that Munc18 along with its interactors is critical for membrane docking and fusion events while Munc 13 along with its interacting proteins is central to priming.

2008	8	binds	Docking and priming of clathrin sculpted acetylcholine loaded transport vesicle occurs once the synaptic vesicle has moved from the cytoplasm to a region apposed to the plasma membrane. The details of the docking and priming reaction have been worked out using synaptic vesicles loaded with glutamate and similar reactions may occur during the transport cycle of acetylcholine. The vesicle is held in close apposition to the plasma membrane by several proteins that bridge the synaptic vesicle to the plasma membrane. Some of these proteins are in the plasma membrane while others are in the synaptic vesicle. Vesicle fusion is preceded by a priming event where molecular interactions between the docked vesicle and the plasma membrane undergo changes. The molecules in the docking and the priming process are known, however, the exact sequence and the precise molecular changes involved in docking and priming are not well dissected. In this reaction the process of docking and priming has been condensed.

A mutant FGFR1c in which Y766 is replaced by phenylalanine is unable to activate PI hydrolysis and Ca2+ release in response to FGF stimulation. Membrane recruitment of PLC-gamma is also aided by binding of the Pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of this enzyme to PtIns(3,4,5) P3 molecules that are generated in response to PI-3 kinase stimulation. By sequence comparison, Y766 is conserved in all FGFR isoforms, and PLC-gamma signaling is observed, to a greater or lesser extent, downstream of all FGFR receptors upon stimulation with FGFs.

2014	8	binds	Long range signaling of Hh depends on a number of additional factors that promote the release and spread of Hh-Np ligand. Dispatched2 (DISP2) is a 12-pass transmembrane protein that was identified as being required for release and long-range signaling by Hh-Np (Burke et al, 1999; Ma et al, 2002; Nakano et al, 2004). In mammals, DISP2 has been shown to bind directly to the cholesterol moiety of Hh-Np through its first extracellular region, and this interaction is required for secretion and long-range signaling. Mutants of DISP2 that are inactive in promoting Hh long-range signaling show tighter binding to Hh-Np, suggesting that these mutants interfere with the release of Hh ligand from the plasma membrane (Tukachinsky et al, 2012). Although this pathway shows DISP2 and Hh-Np interacting at the plasma membrane, it is possible that the interaction occurs earlier in the secretory pathway and that DISP2 escorts Hh-Np to the cell surface.<br><br>In addition to binding to DISP2, the cholesterol moiety of Hh-Np is also bound by the secreted protein SCUBE2 (Tukachinsky et al, 2012; Creanga et al, 2012). Like DISP2, SCUBE2 is required for long-range signaling by Hh-Np (Johnson et al, 2012; Tukachinsky et al, 2012; Creanga et al, 2012). DISP2 and SCUBE2 recognize distinct portions of the cholesterol group on Hh-Np, suggesting a possible hand-off mechanism at the plasma membrane that allows the release of Hh from the secreting cell (Tukachinsky et al, 2012; Creanga et al, 2012).<br>	DISP2;IHH__DHH__SHH

The core protein also contains sites for the attachment of N-linked and O-linked oligosaccharides (Nilsson et al. 1982).<br><br>The G1 N-terminal domain of ACAN has a lectin-like binding site with high affinity for HA (Watanabe et al. 1997, Hardingham 2006). HA is a long unbranched, unsulphated GAG synthesized free from protein attachment by three HA synthases (Spicer & McDonald 1998). It has an average molecular weight of several million Da. HA content steadily rises in aging cartilage and can reach 10% of the total GAG. ACAN, HA and the small glycoprotein HAPLN1, known as Link protein, are found in huge multi-molecular aggregates comprised of numerous ACAN monomers non-covalently bound to HA, stabilized by HAPLN1 which forms a ternary complex with the G1 domain of ACAN and HA (Ratcliffe & Hardingham 1983, Grover & Roughley 1994, Kiani et al. 2002).

2007	8	binds	The 5' end of the vRNA associates with a binding site on the PB1 subunit of the viral RNA polymerase, distinct from the 3' vRNA binding site, which is subsequenty bound forming a loop. These binding events set off allosteric conformational changes in the trimeric polymerase complex that induce PB2 binding of the methylated cap on a host pre-mRNA (Plotch, 1981; Cianci, 1995; Li, 1998; Brownlee, 2002; Kolpashchikov, 2004). PB2 amino acids 242-282 and 538-577 are involved in cap binding (Honda, 1999). Direct or indirect interaction with active, transcribing host RNA polymerase II is thought to supply host mRNA for the caps (Bouloy, 1978; Engelhardt, 2005).	PB2__PA__PB1;vRNA (genomic)__NP
2003	8	binds	U12-type AT-AC introns are distinguished from the major U2-type introns by the consensus sequences of their highly conserved splicing signals. U12 introns have the 5' ss consensus sequence (G/A)TATCCTTT, the branchpoint sequence TTTCCTTAACT and the 3' ss (C/T)AG. Initial recognition of AT-AC introns involves interaction of U12 snRNP with the branch-point sequence and U11 with the 5' ss. Unlike the major splicing pathway, U11 and U12 are in a complex and interact with the pre-mRNA simultaneously, binding in an ATP-dependent manner as a di-snRNP complex and likely bridging the 5' ss and 3' ss region.<p>Twenty proteins have been identified in the U11/U12 di-snRNP complex including the snRNP Sm proteins BÃ¢â¬â¢, B, D3, D2, D1, E, F, and G which are identical to the major splicing pathway Sm proteins. A U2 snRNP core protein complex, SF3b is also found in the U11/U12 di-snRNP, including p14, a protein that interacts with the branchpoint adenosine.<p>SR proteins are required for formation of A complex in AT-AC splicing. The same SR proteins involved in splicing of the major introns are also active in splicing of AT-AC introns, though, as in the major pathway, there is substrate specificity.	SRSF6;U11 snRNA
2010	8	binds	NF-kappa-B essential modulator (NEMO, also known as IKKG abbreviated from Inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B kinase subunit gamma) is the regulatory subunit of the IKK complex which phosphorylates inhibitors of NF-kappa-B leading to dissociation of the inhibitor/NF-kappa-B complex. NEMO binds to K63-pUb chains (Ea et al. 2006; Wu et al. 2006), linking K63-pUb-hp-IRAK1 with the IKK complex. Models of IL-1R dependent activation of NF-kappaB suggest that the polyubiquitination of both TRAF6 and IRAK1 within a TRAF6:IRAK1 complex and their subsequent interactions with the TAK1 complex and IKK complex respectively brings these complexes into proximity, facilitating the TAK1-catalyzed activation of IKK (Moynagh, 2008).

Complexin optimizes partially assembled SNARES for Ca2+ dependent exocytosis. Fusion of the synaptic vesicle is triggered by the influx of Ca2+ through N, P/Q Ca2+ channels, which binds to synaptobrevin on the synaptic vesicles triggering a series of steps leading to fusion of the synaptic vesicle to the presynatic terminal membrane and release of GABA.

2012	8	binds	VAV an activator of RAC-GTPases, is redistributed to plasma membrane and is phosphorylated following engagement of FCERI. Phosphorylated SLP-76 tyrosines Y113 and Y128 (112Y and 128Y in mouse) provide binding sites for the SH2 domains of VAV. The binding of VAV to these phosphotyrosine residues may link SLP-76 to the Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway and the actin cytoskeleton (Kettner et al. 2003).<br>In addition to its known role as guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), VAV also modulates cytokine production in mast cells. VAV1-deficient bone marrow-derived mast cells exhibited reduced degranulation and cytokine production and calcium release in addition of reduced activation of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1), although tyrosine phosphorylation of FCERI, SYK and LAT was normal (Manetz et al. 2001, Arudchandran et al. 2000, Song et al. 1999).

Phosphorylated SLP-76 tyrosines Y113 and Y128 provide binding sites for the SH2 domains of VAV. The binding of VAV to these phosphotyrosine residues may link SLP-76 to the Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway and the actin cytoskeleton. Y145 has been implicated in the binding of SLP-76 to the Tec family kinase BTK (Kettner et al. 2003).

2007	8	binds	Influenza virus buds preferentially from lipid rafts (Scheiffele et al, 1999). NA protein individually accumulates at, and is selectively incorporated into rafts (Kundu et al., 1996). The signals for raft association lie within the transmembranse domain (TMD), (Barman et al., 2001, Barman et al., 2004), and raft association of NA has been shown to be essential for efficient virus replication. This is believed to be due to a requirement for a concentration of NA at specific areas of the plasma membrane to support a level of NA incorporation into budding particles sufficient to allow for efficient virus release (Barman et al., 2004).

Recruitment of NCK to phosphorylated YDxV sites on nephrin could therefore directly control the cytoskeletal actin architecture of podocytes.	WASL;NCK1,NCK2
2006	8	binds	In addition to telomerase-mediated elongation and C-strand synthesis, other DNA processing steps are likely involved in telomere maintenance. In humans, nucleolytic activity is proposed to be involved in generating the G-rich 3' single strand overhang. In addition, differences in the structure of the overhang at telomeres that have undergone leading vs. lagging strand replication suggest that DNA processing may be different at these telomeres (Chai et al. 2006). <br> Electron microscopy studies of purified human telomeric DNA have provided evidence for telomeric loops, or t-loops (Griffith et al. 1999). t-loops are proposed to result from invasion of the 3' G-rich single strand overhang into the double stranded portion of the telomeric TTAGGG repeat tract. The strand displaced by invasion forms a structure called a D loop. The function of the t-loop is presumed to be the protection of the 3' telomeric end. In vitro, the double strand telomeric DNA binding protein TRF2 can increase the frequency of t-loop formation. The prevalence of the t-loops in vivo is not known. <br> Many proteins associate with telomeric DNA. One complex that binds telomeres is called shelterin. Shelterin is a six-protein complex composed of TRF1 and TRF2, which can bind double-stranded telomeric DNA, POT1, which can bind single-stranded telomeric DNA, and three other factors, RAP1, TIN2, and TPP1 (reviewed in de Lange 2006 "Telomeres"). Human telomeric DNA is also bound by nucleosomes (Makarov et al. 1993; Nikitina and Woodcock 2004). A number of other proteins, including some that play roles in the DNA damage response, can be found at telomeres (Zhu et al. 2000; Verdun et al. 2005). <br> Studies in yeast and humans indicate that the association of many proteins with telomeres is regulated through the cell cycle (Smith et al. 1993; Zhu et al. 2000; Taggart et al. 2002; Fisher et al. 2004; Takata et al. 2004; Takata et al. 2005; Verdun et al. 2005). For instance, TRF1, MRE11, POT1, ATM, and NBS1 display cell cycle regulated chromatin immunoprecipitation of telomeric DNA (Zhu et al. 2000; Verdun et al. 2005), and cytologically observable hTERT and hTERC localize to a subset of telomeres only in S-phase (Jady et al. 2006; Tomlinson et al. 2006).

2013	8	binds	Small leucine rich repeat proteoglycans (SLRPs) are a family of extracellular glycoproteins that includes decorin (DCN), biglycan (BGN), fibromodulin, lumican and asporin (Hedbom & Heinegard 1993, Ezura et al. 2000, Schaefer & Iozzo 2008, Iozzo & Schaefer 2010). DCN inhibits cellular proliferation in a TGF-Beta-dependent manner in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells (Yamaguchi et al. 1990), arterial smooth muscle cells (Fischer et al. 2001), human hepatic stellate cells (Shi et al. 2006) and fibroblasts (Zhang et al. 2007). DCN, BGN and fibromodulin can all bind to TGF-Beta (Hildebrand 1994). Binding is mediated by the leucine rich repeat suggesting that all members of the SLRP family have TGF-beta binding capability (Schönherr et al. 1998). DCN has independent binding sites for collagen and TGF-Beta (Schönherr et al. 1998, Cabello-Verrugio et al. 2012). DCN binding is thought to sequester TGF-Beta extracellularly, thereby diminishing its biological activity (Markmann et al. 2000). DCN treatment has beneficial effects in fibrotic disorders involving TGF-Beta overproduction (Border et al. 1992; Kolb et al. 2001, Baghy et al. 2012). BGN attenuates the proliferative actions of TGF-beta1 on fibroblasts (Kobayashi et al. 2003). DCN and BGN appear to mediate crosstalk between Toll-like receptors (TLRs), NOD-like receptors (NLRs) and transforming growth factor Beta (TGFBeta) receptors (reviewed in Moreth et al. 2012).

2004	8	binds	The 85kDa cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2 - PLA2G4A) is involved in cell signalling processes and inflammatory response and is regulated by phosphorylation and calcium concentrations. cPLA2 is phosphorylated at Ser727 and by a MAPK at Ser505. When phosphorylation is coupled with an influx of calcium ions, PLA2 becomes stimulated and translocates to the membrane where it releases arachidonic acid (AA) from membrane phospholipids. Calcium does not itself activate cPLA2. cPLA2 contains an N-terminal calcium-dependent phospholipid binding domain (CaLB) which shares homology with C2 domains (plays roles in signal transduction and membrane trafficking) and binds it to the membrane. Arachidonic acid is both a signalling molecule and the precursor for other signalling molecules termed eicosanoids (e.g., prostaglandins, leukotrienes and platelet-activating factor). A strict regulation of the activity of phospholipase enzyme is essential.	phospho-cPLA2;Ca2+

MCPH1 binding sequesters condensin II by preventing loading of condensin II on chromatin. Simultaneous binding of MCPH1 to the SET oncogene may contribute to condensin II sequestering (Leung et al. 2011). Mutations in MCPH1 are a cause of microchephaly inhereted in an autosomally recessive manner.

2008	8	binds	The cardiovascular and other actions of the vasoconstricting peptide angiotensin II are mediated by the type 1 and type 2 angiotensin II receptors (AT1 and AT2), which are seven transmembrane glycoproteins with 30% sequence similarity. AT1 receptors (Bergsma DJ et al, 1992) couple to G(q/11), and signal through phospholipases A, C, D, inositol phosphates, calcium channels, and a variety of serine/threonine and tyrosine kinases. The AT2 receptor (Tsuzuki S et al, 1994) is expressed mainly during fetal development. It is much less abundant in adult tissues and is up-regulated in pathological conditions. Its signaling pathways include serine and tyrosine phosphatases, phospholipase A2, nitric oxide, and cyclic guanosine monophosphate.

2006	8	binds	At some point in the extension process a sufficient number of regulatory factors that repress telomere extension become bound to the extending telomere. These factors include the TRF1 complexes, TRF2 complexes, telomerase, other factors, and the telomere itself. As repeats are added to the G-rich strand, and once lagging strand synthesis completes the duplex, new binding sites become available for these repressive factors. Once a balance is reached between telomere extension and the telomere repression factors, extension ceases. In this state extension machinery disassociates, leaving the telomere to be folded into a stable conformation.<P>This module details a single transit through the telomere extension process, detailing the addition of two repeats, and the corresponding synthesis of a section of lagging strand. An actual round of <i>in vivo</i> telomere extension would require thousands of telomere repeat additions, and it is the repressive effect of the factors bound to these repeats that turns off telomere extension.

2012	8	binds	Ras guanyl nucleotide-releasing proteins (RasGRPs) are guanyl nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) that activate Ras ultimately leading to MAPK activation. RasGRPs have a catalytic domain composed of Ras exchange motif (REM) and a CDC25 domain, an atypical pair of EF hands that bind calcium and a DAG-binding C1 domain. After PIP2 hydrolysis, RasGRPs are recruited to the plasma membrane by binding to DAG and calcium (Stone 2011, Liu et al. 2007). Upon T-cell activation RasGRP1 specifically interacts with and activates Ras on Golgi instead of the plasma membrane (Bivona et al. 2003). It remains to be determined whether activation of N-Ras by RasGRP1 in mast cells occurs in the Golgi or the plasma membrane (Liu et al. 2007). RasGRP4 is mast cell specific and is involved in the controls Ras activation.	RASGRP4__RasGRP__RASGRP2;Ca2+

2012	8	binds	Alpha 2-macroglobulin (A2M) is a plasma glycoprotein consisting of 4 near-identical subunits (Andersen et al. 1995). A2M inhibits almost all endopeptidases regardless of their specificities (Barrett 1981). A2M binding to an endopeptidase is triggered by cleavage of a peptide bond in the 'bait region' of A2M, triggering a conformational change in A2M that in turn entraps the peptidase without blocking the active site (Barrett & Starkey 1973). This blocks enzyme activity against large protein substrates while not preventing activity on low molecular weight substrates. <br><br>Once bound, A2M-proteinase complexes are endocytosed by low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 (LRP1) (Strickland et al. 1990). <br><br>Active metalloproteinases (MMPs) that can be entrapped by A2M include MMP3 (Enghild et al. 1989) MMP1 (Grinnell et al. 1998) and MMP 13 (Beekman et al. 1999).<br><br>The significance of this mechanism as a regulator of MMP activity is unclear (Baker et al. 2002, Nagase et al. 2006).

2014	8	binds	TRAF family member-associated NF-kB activator (TANK or ITRAF) is a TRAF-binding protein that has been implicated in RLR, TNFR and IL-1R/TLR signaling pathways in mammals (Rothe M et a.l 1996; Pomerantz JL and Baltimore D 1999; Li C et al. 2002; Guo B and Cheng G 2007; Konno H 2009). TANK was shown to interact with TBK1, IKK epsilon, IPS-1, TRIF (TICAM1), IRF3 and is thought to be a part of the TRAF3-containing complex (Pomerantz JL and Baltimore D 1999; Guo B and Cheng G 2007; Gatot JC et al. 2007). Upon microbe stimulation TANK is believed to induce IRF-dependent type I IFN production in mammalian cells by linking kinase TBK1 or IKK epsilon with upstream mediators TRAF3/6 (Guo B and Cheng G 2007; Gatot JC et al. 2007). In addition, TANK is thought to act synergistically with IKK epsilon or TBK1 to link them to IKK complex via interaction with NEMO (IKK gamma), where TBK1/IKK epsilon may modulate NFkB activation (Chariot A et al. 2002). TANK influence on NFkB activation was found to occur via either positive or negative regulation (Guo B and Cheng G 2007, Konno H et al. 2009; Pomerantz JL and Baltimore D 1999; Kawagoe T et al. 2009).<p> Two other adaptor proteins NAK-associated protein 1 (NAP1) and SINTBAD (not shown here) have been implicated in TBK1/IKKepsilon-mediated activation of IRF3 (Sasai M et al. 2005; Ryzhakov G and Randow F 2007). Structural and functional studies showed that TANK, NAP1 and SINTBAD share a common region which mediates association with the coiled-coil 2 in TBK1 (Ryzhakov G and Randow F 2007; Goncalves A et al. 2011; Larabi A et al. 2013; Tu D et al. 2013). TANK, NAP1 and SINTBAD were found to compete for TBK1 binding (Ryzhakov G and Randow F 2007; Goncalves A et al. 2011), TBK1 is thought to form alternative complexes with each adaptor TANK, NAP1 or SINTBAD, rather than a single large multiprotein complex containing all three adaptors (Goncalves A et al. 2011; Larabi A et al. 2013).

2009	8	binds	Rhodopsin (encoded by the human gene OPN2) (Nathans J and Hogness DS, 1984) is expressed in rod photoreceptor cells used in night vision. In humans, three opsins are expressed in cone cells used for colour vision. The opsin 1 gene OPN1MW encodes a protein called green cone photopigment or medium-wave-sensitive opsin (Nathans J et al, 1986). Defects in OPN1MW are the cause of partial colorblindness called deuteranopia (Winderickx J et al, 1992).<br>The opsin 1 gene OPN1LW encodes a protein called red cone photopigment or long-wavelength sensitive opsin (Nathans J et al, 1986). Defects in this gene are the cause of partial colorblindness (protanopia) (Winderickx J et al, 1992). The opsin 1 gene OPN1SW encodes for blue-sensitive opsins (BOP) (Nathans J et al, 1986). A deficiency in function or numbers (or both) of BOP results in a selective deficiency of blue spectral sensitivity. This is called Tritanopia, an autosomal dominant genetic disorder of human vision (Weitz CJ et al, 1992).<br>The human gene OPN3 encodes opsin 3 (encephalopsin, panopsin) (Blackshaw S and Snyder SH, 1999). It is strongly expressed in brain and testis with features of a classical photoreceptive opsin. The human gene OPN5 encodes opsin 5, which is expressed in the eye, brain, testes, and spinal cord (Tarttelin EE et al, 2003).<br>The visual pigment-like receptor peropsin (RRH) is found only in the eye, where it is localized to the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) (Sun H et al, 1997). In the RPE, it is localized to the microvilli that surround the photoreceptor outer segments. It may play a role in RPE physiology, either by detecting light directly or by monitoring the concentration of retinoids or other photoreceptor-derived compounds.<br>The putative RPE-retinal G protein coupled receptor (RGR) (Shen D et al, 1994) covalently binds both all-trans- and 11-cis-retinal after reduction by sodium borohydride.

RP leads to degeneration of retinal photoreceptor cells (Morimura H et al, 1999).<br>Transducin (also called Gt) is a heterotrimeric G protein that is naturally expressed in vertebrate retina rods and cones and couple with these opsins to mediate the stimulation of cGMP hydrolysis.

Tfc1 and Tfc7 have strong cross-links within and near the 3 end of the A box, respectively (Bartholomew et al., 1990). Tfc8 does not cross-link to DNA, and after partial protease digestion of TFIIIC, is found in the tB domain. In addition, however, Tfc8 displays genetic interactions with Tfc1, TBP, and ScBdp1, and it associates with TBP in vitro, suggesting that it is also present in the tA domain. The Tfc4 subunit cross-links to sites around and upstream of the transcription start site (Bartholomew et al., 1990) and directly contacts both the ScBrf1 and ScBdp1 subunits of TFIIIB.<p>Numerous protein-protein contacts between various TFIIIC subunits have been described, which are symbolized by small rectangles in the figure. The black rectangles indicate contacts identified with human TFIIIC subunits, the grey rectangles with S. cerevisiae TFIIIC subunits. Thus, Tfc7 interacts directly with Tfc1. TTFIIIC90 interacts with TFIIIC220, TFIIIC110, and TFIIIC63 (Hsieh et al., 1999). TFIIIC102 interacts with TFIIIC63 (Hsieh et al., 1999). Various TFIIIC subunits also interact directly with Brf1-TFIIIB subunits, as shown in the figure.	DNA with RNA Polymerase III Type 2 Closed Promoter;GTF3C1__GTF3C3__GTF3C2__GTF3C4__GTF3C5
2003	8	binds	The membrane associated cGMP phosphodiesterase 6 (PDE6) is a tetramer of two catalytic chains, alpha (PDE6A or PDEA) (Pittler et al. 1990) and beta (PDE6B or PDEB) (Weber et al. 1991), and two inhibitory gamma chains (PDE6G or PDEG) (Tuteja et al. 1990). Binding of an activated transducin alpha subunit (GNAT1-GTP) to PDE-gamma relaxes the inhibitory effect of the gamma subunit thereby activating the associated alpha or beta catalytic subunit. Because the binding of GNAT1-GTP to PDE-gamma is one to one, there is no amplification associated with this step. Active Gt alpha (GNAT-GTP) can be inactivated by a slow, intrinsic GTPase activity that hydrolyses GTP to GDP. Once GNAT1 has GDP bound, it no longer binds to the gamma subunit of PDE6 (PDE6-gamma) that then resumes inhibition of the catalytic subunit of PDE6. Some forms of autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa and congenital stationary night blindness are caused by mutations in PDE6 (https://sph.uth.edu/retnet/).<br>	GTP__N-ACYL-GNAT1;PDE6B__PDE6G__PDE6A

2013	8	binds	Activated DAAM1 recruits RHO A to the DVL complex in a WNT-dependent manner. Activated DAAM1 is able to bind to RHO A in both the GDP and GTP bound form in vitro, but displays higher affinity for GTP-bound RHO A (Habas et al, 2001; Liu et al, 2007). Studies in Xenopus have identified a DVL-associated weak guanine exchange factor (WGEF) that promotes the exchange of GDP for GTP on RHO A and is required for WNT-PCP signaling (Tanegashima et al, 2008). Evidence suggests that a similar GEF activity is associated with the DVL-DAAM1-RHO A complex in human cells, but the protein has not been definitively identified (Habas et al, 2001; Liu et al, 2007). GTP-bound RHO A relieves the auto-inhibition of RHO-associated kinases, allowing them to dimerize and effect changes to cytoskeletal organization (reviewed in Amano et al, 2010; Lai et al, 2009). DAAM1 may also play a more direct role in regulating the cytoskeleton in response to WNT signaling, since FH domains have been shown to bind actin directly to nucleate linear actin cables (Sagot et al, 2002; Watanabe and Higashida, 2004).	pp-DVL__DAAM1;RHOA__GTP__Mg2+

2007	8	binds	BMP receptors, unlike TGF-beta receptors are known to form hetero-oligomeric complexes in the endoplasmic reticulum and are transported as oligomers to the plasma membrane where they bind ligand. However, evidence for ligand-induced heteromeric BMP receptor complexes on the cell surface has also been published, leading to a model where both pre-formed and ligand-induced receptor oligomers are encountered on the plasma membrane. Based on the latter, a theory has been formulated that suggests that the signaling outcome from pre-formed and ligand-induced BMP receptor complexes is different. The mechanism that might explain this theory must involve different ways of internalization and trafficking of the BMP receptor complexes.	Type I receptor;Type II receptor

2013	8	binds	In articular cartilage the major non-fibrous macromolecules are aggrecan, hyaluronan (HA) and hyaluronan and proteoglycan link protein 1 (HAPLN1). The high negative charge density of these molecules leads to the binding of large amounts of water (Bruckner 2006). HA is bound by large aggregating proteoglycans (the hyalectans).

2013	8	binds	Stress-induced HSF1 trimerization results in the increased affinity of HSF1 for the heat shock elements (HSE) usually located within promoters of HSF1 target genes (Sarge KD et al. 1993; Wang Y and Morgan WD 1994; Herbomel G et al. 2013). HSEs are highly conserved and consist of contiguous inverted repeats of pentameric sequence nGAAn (i.e., nGAAnnTTCnnGAAn) (Abravaya K et al. 1991; Sarge KD et al. 1993; Cunniff NFA & Morgan WD 1993). The promoters of HSF target genes can contain more than one HSE, suggesting that the HSF1-HSE interaction may occur in cooperative manner when the binding of HSF trimer to HSE facilitates binding of the next HSF1 trimer (Wang Y and Morgan WD 1994).<p>Replication protein A (RPA), which is involved in DNA metabolism, was shown to support transcription factor access to nucleosomal DNA as a scaffold for HSF1 and a histone chaperone, FACT (Fujimoto M et al. 2012).<p>Mutagenesis analysis revealed that DNA binding domain of human HSF1 is required for HSF1 binding to HSE and for nuclear stress bodies (nSBs) formation (Westerheide SD et al. 2009; Herbomel G et al. 2013).<p>While HSF1 can bind to promoters of many genes targets with or without inducing their transcription, it is best known for stress-induced regulatory functions on certain chaperone genes, such as HSPA1A/HSP70, HSPC/HSP90, HSPB1/HSP27, and DNAJB1/HSP40 (Mosser DD et al. 1988; Trinklein ND et al. 2004a,b; Page TG et al. 2006). At the same time, however, the constitutive expression of hsp70, hsp60, BiP/GRP78, and hsp27 in cultured embryonic murine cells was unaffected by the disruption of the hsf1 gene (McMillan et al. 1998). This is additionally supported by findings that the production of HSP70 was not induced after transfection of HSF1 into human epidermoid A431 cells despite the fact that HSF1 was found to bind HSE on hsp70 gene. While HSP70 production was not altered in unstressed cells, the treatment with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) increased the HSP70 level in A431 cells and reached even higher expression level in HSF1-transfected A431 cells (Ding XZ et al. 1997). Thus, HSF1 is required for stress-induced upregulation of hsp genes while may not be involved in their basal expression (as was shown in higher eukaryotes).

The heterophilic interaction of alpha v beta 3 integrin on endothelial cells with PEACAM-1 on leukocytes increases the adhesive function of beta integrins on T cells, monocytes, neutrophils and NK cells suggesting that leukocyte PEACAM-1 act as a signaling molecule.

2008	8	binds	Basigin serves as a signaling receptor for extracellular cyclophilins. Its been reported that cyclophilin 60 (Cyp60), a distinct member of the cyclophilin family is involved in the regulation of intracellular transport of basigin. The mechanism of this activity involves interaction of Cyp60 with the proline-containing region within or adjacent to the predicted transmembrane domain basigin. Cyp60 is co-localized with basigin at the plasma membrane suggesting that Cyp60 may function as a chaperone escorting basigin through the secretory pathway.	PPIL2;BSG

The transmembrane DCC receptor is a Netrin-1 receptor, involved in the attractive effects of Netrin-1. Contact-dependent mechanisms promote extension of growth cones across the floor plate to the contralateral side, whereupon growth cones acquire sensitivity to the midline repellent Slit and grow away from the midline.<br>Netrin-1 binds directly to the fifth Fibronectin III motif of DCC, thereby inducing DCC clustering through the association between the DCC P3 domains, a process required for an attractive response.

The R-SMAD:Co-SMAD complex (Nakao et al. 1997) most likely is a trimer of two R-SMADs with one Co-SMAD (Kawabata et al. 1998). It is important to note that the Co-SMAD itself cannot be phosphorylated as it lacks the C-terminal serine motif.<br><br>ZFYVE16 (endofin) promotes SMAD heterotrimer formation. ZFYVE16 can bind TGFBR1 and facilitate SMAD2 phosphorylation, and it can also bind SMAD4, but the exact mechanism of ZFYVE16 (endofin) action in the context of TGF-beta receptor signaling is not known (Chen et al. 2007).	p-2S-SMAD2__p-2S-SMAD3;SMAD4

2007	8	binds	Leukocyte immunoglobulin (Ig)-like receptors [LILRs, also known as Ig-like transcripts (ILTs)] are a family of inhibitory and stimulatory receptors encoded within the leukocyte receptor complex and are expressed by immune cell types of both myeloid and lymphoid lineage. Several members of the LILR family recognize major histocompatibility complex class I. The immunomodulatory role of LILR receptors indicates that they may exert an influence on signaling pathways of both innate and adaptive immune systems.<p><p>Signaling mechanisms are employed that are similar to the ones adopted by the closely related killer cell inhibitory receptors (KIRs). ITIMs recruit inhibitory phosphatases that dephosphorylate ITIM and ITAM domains in order to influence intracellular signaling cascades.

Endogenous human SMAD7 and SMURF2 were shown to form a complex in human U4A/Jak1 cells, derived from a sarcoma cell line 2fTGH. The interaction was studied in more detail by expressing tagged recombinant human SMURF2 and mouse Smad7 in human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293 (Kavsak et al. 2000, Ogunjimi et al. 2005).

2012	8	binds	SMURF2 monoubiquitinates SMAD3 on lysine residues in the MH2 domain. Lysines K333 and K378 are likely the major sites for monoubiquitination. Lysine K409 is also monoubiquitinated, and possibly lysine K341. Since lysines K333 and K378 are predicted to stabilize the interaction of SMAD3 with SMAD4, monoubiquitination of these lysine residues is expected to disrupt SMAD2/3:SMAD4 heterotrimer. SMURF2-mediated disruption of endogenous Smad2/3:Smad4 heterotrimers was demonstrated in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. SMURF2 also ubiquitinates SMAD2 phosphorylated in the linker region, but loss of Smurf2 has less impact on Smad2 ubiquitination than on Smad3 in vivo.	SMURF2;SMAD4

The recognition mechanism is specific for Lys63-linked ubiquitin chains [Kulathu Y et al 2009]. TAK1 can be activated by unattached Lys63-polyubiquitinated chains when TRAF6 has no detectable polyubiquitination (Xia et al. 2009) and thus the synthesis of these chains by TRAF6 may be the signal transduction mechanism.

2013	8	binds	There are four human RSpondin genes in humans whose products are secreted agonists of canonical and non-canonical WNT signaling (Kim et al, 2005; Glinka et al, 2007; reviewed in Kim et al, 2006). RSPO proteins enhance signaling in the presence of WNT ligand and have been shown to bind to the leucine-rich repeat containing G protein coupled receptors (LGR) 4, 5 and 6 (Kim et al, 2005; Binnerts et al, 2007; Carmon et al, 2011; de Lau et al, 2011). RSPO:LGR complexes are postulated to potentiate WNT-dependent signaling in a number of potentially overlapping mechanisms. RSPO proteins enhance WNT-mediated phosphorylation of LRP6 in HEK293 cells (Wei et al, 2007; Binnerts et al, 2007; Carmon et al, 2011). A recent report suggests that this effect may be mediated in part by downregulating the levels of ZNFR3 at the plasma membrane. ZNFR3 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that has been shown to ubiquitinate FZD and to promote internalization of FZD and LRP6. In the presence of RSPO:LGR, ZNFR3 itself is targeted for internalization, allowing enhanced signaling through the WNT receptor complex (Yao et al, 2012).	LGR4__LGR5__LGR6;RSPO2__RSPO4__RSPO3__RSPO1

Apelin is one of the most potent stimulators of cardiac contractility and mediates blood pressure and blood flow. Several active peptides can be produced by proteolytic processing of the peptide precursor (apelin-36, 31, 28 and 13). APJ is related to the angiotensin receptor (40-50% identity) and couples to G proteins that inhibit adenylate cyclase activity. It is an alternative coreceptor with CD4 for HIV-1 infection.

In vitro, DNA-PK undergoes autophosphorylation which correlates with loss of protein kinase activity and disruption of the DNA-PKcs-Ku-DNA complex (Chan and Lees-Miller, 1996; Douglas et al, 2001; 2002; Merkle et al, 2002). Moreover, autophosphorylation of DNA-PKcs is required for NHEJ in vivo (Chan et al, 2002; Ding et al, 2003), suggesting that autophosphorylation may serve as a mechanism to remove DNA-PKcs from DNA prior to end joining.

2003	8	binds	TFIIIA contains nine C2H2 zinc fingers (Arakawa et al., 1995). It binds to both the ICR region of the 5S RNA genes and to 5S RNA to form the 7S storage ribonucleoprotein particle (Pelham and Brown, 1980). Upon TFIIIA binding to the 5S gene, the TFIIIA zinc fingers are aligned over the length of the ICR with the C-terminal zinc fingers in proximity to the 5 end, and the N-terminal zinc fingers in proximity to the 3 end, of the ICR. Zinc fingers 1-3 contact the C block within the ICR and have been reported to contribute most of the binding energy of the full-length protein (Clemens et al., 1992). However, TFIIIA fragments containing zinc fingers 4-9 bind to the A block and intermediate element within the ICR with affinities close to those of the full-length protein. This and other observations suggest that simultaneous binding by all nine TFIIIA zinc fingers requires energetically unfavorable distortions within the DNA, the protein, or both (Kehres et al., 1997).

This uncoating step may be a point in the pathway subject to regulation. This final step releases the vesicle from the clathrin cage. The vesicle still contatins a specific Vamp molecule, part of the targeting and fusion mechanism that delivers the vesicle to its ultimate destination. This vesicle also contains its cargo, membrane proteins embeded in the lysosome membrane.	VAMP8__VAMP2__VAMP7;BLOC1S1__M6PR

2008	8	binds	In the presence of high concentrations of zinc and calcium, proinsulin spontaneously forms soluble complexes containing 6 molecules of proinsulin, 2 zinc ions, and 1 calcium ion. Zinc Transporters ZnT5, ZnT6, and ZnT7 are found in the membrane of the Golgi in pancreatic cells (and also in many other cell types). They play a role in maintaining the high zinc concentration in the Golgi lumen and thus catalyze the formation of the proinsulin-zinc-calcium complex. Other transporters, such as the newly identified ZnT9 and ZnT10, may also be involved but this is presently unknown.	Ca2+;Zn2+

2008	8	binds	Cubilin (CUBN) is a membrane-associated protein colocalizing with megalin. Its function is to sequester steroid carrier complexes such as vitamin D binding protein:calcidiol (GC:CDL) on the cell surface before megalin mediates their internalization (Nykjaer et al. 2001).	GC__CDL;CUBN
2010	8	binds	Factor H (FH) regulates the alternative pathway C3 convertase C3bBb and its C3b component both in plasma and at host cell surfaces. FH binds to membrane-associated C3b, competing with Factor B and thereby preventing formation of the active C3 convertase C3bBb. In addition, it acts as a cofactor for the Factor I-mediated proteolytic inactivation of C3b to iC3b.	CFH__CFHR3;Cell surface
2010	8	binds	Following the displacement of Bb from C3bBb, Factor I cleaves Factor H-bound C3b producing iC3b, which remains bound to the membrane. The majority of the C3b alpha chain is retained as two fragments which are tethered to the beta chain by disulphide bonds. iC3b is proteolytically inactive and cannot contribute to the complement cascade process, though it still contributes to opsonization.

Complement factor H-related protein 3 (FHR-3) has also been reported to bind C3Bb leading to inhibition of C3Bb C3 convertase activity (Fritsche et al. 2010). FH also acts as a cofactor for the factor I-mediated proteolytic inactivation of C3b to iC3b.	CFH__CFHR3;CFB(260-764)__Cell surface
2010	8	binds	The alpha subunit of the GM-CSF receptor binds GM-CSF with relatively low affinity. Binding of this dimer to the common beta subunit (Bc) confers high affinity binding. Recent models of receptor activation suggest a sequential activation that is initiated by the low-affinity interaction of GM-CSF with the alpha chain to form a binary complex. This binary complex is then able to bind preformed Bc dimers generating a 2:2:2 hexameric complex (Hansen et al. 2008).	CSF2RA__CSF2;JAK2__IL3RB

SREBP2 activates HMGCR slightly more than does SREBP1A (Pai et al. 1998). SREBP1A/2 binds 2 main sites and 2 auxiliary sites in the HMGCR promoter (Vallett et al. 1996).	HMGCR gene;NFYC__NFYA__NFYB

2007	8	binds	The 5' end of the vRNA associates with a binding site on the PB1 subunit of the viral RNA polymerase, distinct from the 3' vRNA binding site, which is subsequenty bound forming a loop. These binding events set off allosteric conformational changes in the trimeric polymerase complex that induce PB2 binding of the methylated cap on a host pre-mRNA (Plotch, 1981; Cianci, 1995; Li, 1998; Brownlee, 2002; Kolpashchikov, 2004). PB2 amino acids 242-282 and 538-577 are involved in cap binding (Honda, 1999). Direct or indirect interaction with active, transcribing host RNA polymerase II is thought to supply host mRNA for the caps (Bouloy, 1978; Engelhardt, 2005).

2003	8	binds	Ionizing radiation (IR) induces single-strand breaks i.e. cleavage of the phosphodiester backbone. When two single-strand breaks occur within approximately 10 base pairs, a DNA double-strand break results. IR-induced DSBs are complex DNA damage lesions, containing base damage and frequently containing 5'-OH groups and 3'-hydroxy or phosphoglycolate groups that must be removed prior to ligation in the final step of NHEJ (Friedberg et al, 1995; Nikjoo et al, 2001; Valerie and Povirk, 2003). The Ku70/80 heterodimer (Walker et al., 2001) binds to the ends of the double-strand break. Ku can translocate inwards from the site of the break in an ATP-independent manner (reviewed in Dynan and Yoo, 1998).	Ku70__Ku86;DNA double-strand break ends
2010	8	binds	PTP1B has been shown to associate with GH-dependent phosphorylated GHR and induce its dephosphorylation (Pasquali et al. 2003). It can also dephosphorylate JAK2 (Gu et al. 2003). Both have the effect of reducing JAK signaling.	Growth Hormone;PTPN1

2010	8	binds	Deletion mutants have demonstrated that STAT dimerization can occur independently of the binding of 2 STAT molecules by a dimeric receptor. Although this does not exclude the possibility that STATs may dimerize while still associated with the receptor complex, dimerization is believed to occur following release of the phosphorylated monomers from the receptor complex and is typically represented in this manner (e.g. Turkson & Jove 2000).	Growth Hormone;STA5A__STA5B
2010	8	binds	JAK2 is required for GH-mediated phosphorylation of STATs 1,3,5A and 5B (Smit et al.1996). Some STAT activation may be mediated by direct association of JAK and STAT but maximal activation requires binding of STATs to phosphorylated tyrosines of the receptor (Smit et al. 1996, Lichanska & Waters 2006). Studies using mouse GHR truncated at K391, equivalent to human K380, suggest that STAT5 signaling is mediated by distal tyrosines, with 70% of the signaling lost if the receptor is truncated at P569, equivalent to human P558 (Rowland et al. 2005). Wang et al. (1996) using the porcine receptor found that phosphorylation at any one of the positions Y487, Y534, Y566 or Y627 (numbering identical in humans) was sufficient to allow STAT5 phosphorylation. Smit et al. (1996) identified mouse residues Y341 (human Y332) and Y346 (not conserved in human) as required for STAT1, 3, and maximal STAT5 activation.	Growth Hormone;STAT5B__STAT5A
2008	8	binds	Single C motif-1 (SCM-1; lymphotactin, CXC1) is a member of the chemokine receptor family (Yoshida T et al, 1995). CXC differs from the CC chemokines by one amino acid separating two of the four conserved cysteine residues (to give the motif CXC) whereas two adjacent cysteines denote CC. In humans, there are two highly conserved SCM-1 genes, SCYC1 and 2, which encode two SCM-1 proteins, SCM1-alpha and beta (Yoshida T et al, 1996). These proteins act as specific ligands for the CXC1 receptor. This receptor is highly expressed in placenta but lowly in spleen and thymus.	XCL2__XCL1;XCR1

The impact of fringe-mediated modification of NOTCH2 on activation by DLL4 has not been examined.	DLL4;NOTCH2(1582-2471)__18xFucT-16xGlcS-FucS-NOTCH2(26-1581)

2006	8	binds	Claspin is loaded onto DNA replication origins during replication initiation. Studies in Xenopus egg extracts indicate claspin loading requires the presence of Cdc45, a factor that promotes the initial unwinding of the origin DNA in the presence of Cdk2. This step is followed by RPA binding which is a prerequisite for recruitment of PCNA and DNA polymerases alpha and delta. As RPA is not required for claspin binding, it is postulated that claspin binds at the time of initial origin unwinding but prior to the initiation of DNA synthesis. Claspin would then continue to associate with replication fork machinery where it can serve as a checkpoint sensor protein. Even though associated with the replication fork, claspin is not an essential DNA replication factor.<p>Studies of Xenopus claspin indicate that it can physically associate with cognate Cdc45, DNA polymerase epsilon, RPA, RFC, and Rad17-RFC on chromatin. Studies of purified human claspin indicate that it binds with high affinity to branched (or forked) DNA structures that resemble stalled replication forks. Electron microscopy of these complexes indicates that claspin binds as a ring-like structure near the branch. The protein is hypothesized to encircle the DNA at these sites.	CDC45;CLSPN
2007	8	binds	Influenza virus buds preferentially from lipid rafts (Scheiffele et al, 1999). NA protein individually accumulates at, and is selectively incorporated into rafts (Kundu et al., 1996). The signals for raft association lie within the transmembranse domain (TMD), (Barman et al., 2001, Barman et al., 2004), and raft association of NA has been shown to be essential for efficient virus replication. This is believed to be due to a requirement for a concentration of NA at specific areas of the plasma membrane to support a level of NA incorporation into budding particles sufficient to allow for efficient virus release (Barman et al., 2004).

2008	8	binds	Bradykinin (Rocha e Silva M, et al, 1949) is a 9 amino-acid peptide belonging to the kinin group of proteins. It causes blood vessel dilation via the release of prostacyclin, nitric oxide and endothelial-derived hyperpolarizing factor, resulting in lower blood pressure. It is also involved in the pain mechanism. Bradykinin exerts its effects through two receptors, bradykinin receptor B1 and 2 (B1R and B2R respectively). B1R (Menke JG et al, 1994) is synthesized de novo following tissue injury and receptor binding leads to an increase in cytosolic calcium concentration, resulting in chronic and acute inflammatory responses. Unlike B1R, B2R (Hess JF et al, 1992) is ubiquitously and constitutively expressed in healthy tissues. It also increase cytosolic calcium concentration and stimulates the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways.	BDKRB1__BDKRB2;Bradykinin
2008	8	binds	The nephrin-slit diaphragm protein complex contains a group of scaffolding proteins that function to connect junctional membrane proteins to the actin cytoskeleton and signaling cascades. By mass spectrometry four of the proteins identified, alphaII spectrin, betaII spectrin, alpha-actinin, and IQGAP1, represent adherens junction-associated proteins, and two, MAGI-2/S-SCAM and CASK, represent MAGUK family scaffolding proteins that associate with Ig superfamily proteins. The presence of these proteins in slit diaphragms and their association with nephrin suggests that they may form a scaffolding protein complex in the podocyte slit diaphragm and thus contribute to the regulation of ultrafiltration by binding slit membrane proteins and establishing their cytosolic connections.

2014	8	binds	After being activated by an insertion/deletion loop (IDL), MSH2:MSH3 (MutSbeta) recruits MLH1:PMS2 (MutLalpha) (Iyer et al. 2010, Pluciennik et al. 2013) and interacts with PCNA (Iyer et al. 2010). As inferred from yeast, more than one molecule of MLH1:PMS2 may bind per molecule of MSH2:MSH3 (Hombauer et al. 2011). MLH1:PMS2 and PCNA compete for the same binding site on MSH2:MSH3 (Iyer et al. 2010). The interaction with PCNA determines which strand of DNA will serve as template and which strand will be repaired (Zhang et al. 2005, and inferred from MSH2:MSH6).	PMS2__MLH1;PCNA

2009	8	binds	The classical view of G-protein signalling is that the G-protein alpha subunit dissociates from the beta:gamma dimer. Activated G alpha (s) and the beta:gamma dimer then participate in separate signaling cascades. Although G protein dissociation has been contested (e.g. Bassi et al. 1996), recent in vivo experiments have demonstrated that dissociation does occur, though possibly not to completion (Lambert 2008).

2012	8	binds	TGFBR1 binds to PARD6A, a component of tight junctions, and localizes to tight junctions irrespective of TGF-beta stimulation. The N-terminus of PARD6A, containing a PB1 domain necessary for interactions with PRKCZ, is necessary for binding to TGFBR1 (Ozdamar et al. 2005).<br>PARD6A, bound to PARD3 and PRKCZ, is associated with tight junctions through JAM-A (Ebnet et al. 2001), which is bound to CGN (cingulin) (Bazzoni et al. 2000). CGN binds ARHGEF18 (p114RhoGEF), and ARHGEF18 recruits RHOA to tight junctions. Other components of the tight junction structure are not shown in this context (Terry et al. 2011). <br>Junctional RHOA activity is required for maintenance of junctional integrity through regulation of actinomyosin cytoskeleton organization (Terry et al. 2011). This was inferred from experiments in which a recombinant mouse Pard6a and recombinant human TGFBR1 were studied in the context of endogenous mouse tight junctions.

The latter is expressed preferentially on T-cells and platelets. In the immune system, CD40-CD40L interaction affects some key processes such as immune cell activation, differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. CD40-CD40L interaction also upregulates costimulatory molecules (ICAM-1, VCAM-1, E-selectin, LFA-3, B7.1, B7.2, class II MHC, and CD40 itself).	CD40-1;TNFSF5

2008	8	binds	Csk is a tyrosine kinase that phosphorylates the negative regulatory C-terminal tyrosine residue Y505 of Lck to maintain Lck in an inactive state. In resting T cells, Csk is targeted to lipid rafts through engagement of its SH2 domain with phosphotyrosine residue pY317 of PAG. PAG is expressed as a tyrosine phosphorylated protein in nonstimulated T-cells. This interaction of Csk and PAG allows activation of Csk and inhibition of Lck. Given that PAG-1 T cell knock out show a weak phenotype, some other protein may substitute in activating Csk.	CSK;p-CBP

2006	8	binds	In addition to telomerase-mediated elongation and C-strand synthesis, other DNA processing steps are likely involved in telomere maintenance. In humans, nucleolytic activity is proposed to be involved in generating the G-rich 3' single strand overhang. In addition, differences in the structure of the overhang at telomeres that have undergone leading vs. lagging strand replication suggest that DNA processing may be different at these telomeres (Chai et al. 2006). <br> Electron microscopy studies of purified human telomeric DNA have provided evidence for telomeric loops, or t-loops (Griffith et al. 1999). t-loops are proposed to result from invasion of the 3' G-rich single strand overhang into the double stranded portion of the telomeric TTAGGG repeat tract. The strand displaced by invasion forms a structure called a D loop. The function of the t-loop is presumed to be the protection of the 3' telomeric end. In vitro, the double strand telomeric DNA binding protein TRF2 can increase the frequency of t-loop formation. The prevalence of the t-loops in vivo is not known. <br> Many proteins associate with telomeric DNA. One complex that binds telomeres is called shelterin. Shelterin is a six-protein complex composed of TRF1 and TRF2, which can bind double-stranded telomeric DNA, POT1, which can bind single-stranded telomeric DNA, and three other factors, RAP1, TIN2, and TPP1 (reviewed in de Lange 2006 "Telomeres"). Human telomeric DNA is also bound by nucleosomes (Makarov et al. 1993; Nikitina and Woodcock 2004). A number of other proteins, including some that play roles in the DNA damage response, can be found at telomeres (Zhu et al. 2000; Verdun et al. 2005). <br> Studies in yeast and humans indicate that the association of many proteins with telomeres is regulated through the cell cycle (Smith et al. 1993; Zhu et al. 2000; Taggart et al. 2002; Fisher et al. 2004; Takata et al. 2004; Takata et al. 2005; Verdun et al. 2005). For instance, TRF1, MRE11, POT1, ATM, and NBS1 display cell cycle regulated chromatin immunoprecipitation of telomeric DNA (Zhu et al. 2000; Verdun et al. 2005), and cytologically observable hTERT and hTERC localize to a subset of telomeres only in S-phase (Jady et al. 2006; Tomlinson et al. 2006). These data indicate that telomeres are dynamically remodeled through the cell cycle.	HIST1H4__Histone H2A__HIST3H3__Histone H2B;POT1

(2003) detected the components of the peptide loading complex (TAP, tapasin, calreticulin and ERp57) together with MHC class I in purified early phagosomes. They observed peptide loading in the presence of ATP in purified phagosomes expressing HLA-A2, incubated with iodinated S-9-L peptide. From these experiments they concluded that TAP-imported peptides can be loaded on MHC class I molecules in the lumen of phagosomes. Houde et al.

In addition to the LFG motif, the amino terminal sequence conserved in the p107 (RBL1) and p130 (RBL2) is needed for inhibition of CDK2 kinase activity.

2006	8	binds	Sortilin is a membrane protein that acts as co-receptor for p75NTR. Superior cervical ganglion (SCG) neurons, vascular smooth muscle (SM-11) cells, oligodendrocytes and CNS neurons (including basal forebrain neurons) (Volosin et al, 2006) express significant levels of sortilin and p75NTR. Schwann cells, instead, do not express sortilin. It is expressed during embryogenesis in areas where NGF and proNGF have well-characterized effects. It is important for proNGF signalling, but has little or no role on mature NGF initiated signalling. ProNGF preferentially binds to a p75NTR:sortilin complex, whereas mature NGF preferentially binds p75NTR alone. ProNGF binds to p75NTR with a dissociation constant (Kd) ~15-20 nM, and to sortilin with a Kd ~5 nM. In the presence of sortilin, proNGF binds to p75NTR with a Kd 0.2 nM. In contrast, mature NGF binds to p75NTR with a Kd of 1-2 nM, whereas it binds sortilin very weakly (Kd ~ 90 nM). Therefore, in the presence of sortilin, p75NTR binds more strongly to proNGF than to NGF, and proNGF signalling predominates. In the absence of sortilin, NGF binding is stronger than proNGF, and it is the mature NGF signalling that prevails. proNGF interacts with sortilin via its pro-domain, whereas the interaction with p75NTR is mediated by the mature domain.

DAI forms a complex with two RHIM-containing kinases - RIP1 and RIP3 (Kaiser WJ et al 2008, Rebsamen M et al 2009). Recruitment of RIP3 to DAI was reported to induce RIP3 autophosphorylation. Furthermore, knockdown of RIP1 or RIP3 affected DAI-induced NFkB signals in murine L929 fibroblast and human HEK293T cells (Kaiser WJ et al 2008, Rebsamen M et al 2009).	RIP3;RIPK1
2011	8	binds	Activin binds the Activin receptor composed of a type II receptor (ACVR2A/B) and a type I receptor, in this case ACVR1B (ALK4) (Attisano et al. 1996, Zhou et al. 2000). Activin appears to interact initially with the type II receptor component (Attisano et al. 1996). It is unclear if the type II and type I receptors are associated before binding Activin. Any of Activin A (INHBA:INHBA), Activin AB (INHBA:INHBB), and Activin B (INHBB:INHBB) can bind and signal via an activin receptor containing the ACVR1B (ALK4) type I receptor.	ACVR2__ACVR2B;ALK4
2010	8	binds	The Interleukin-5 receptor alpha subunit (IL5Ra) has a single transmembrane domain, a glycosylated extracellular domain and a short (58 amino acids) cytoplasmic tail, containing no tyrosine kinase domain. It binds IL-5 with a relatively low affinity and is not capable of signaling by itself. The alpha subunit has alternatively spliced soluble forms that are capable of binding IL-5 and act as natural antagonists of IL-5 signaling. The cytoplasmic domain of the alpha chain appears to be critical for IL-5 signaling (Takaki et al. 1993). IL5R alpha chain was found to be constitutively associated with JAK2 (Ogata et al. 1998); the same study found that JAK1 was constitutively associated with Bc, though the consensus is that JAK2 is associated with Bc.

2014	8	binds	The ATPase activity of VCP is required for the retrotranslocation of Hh-C across the ER membrane (Chen et al, 2011). Although in this pathway, the VCP hexamer is shown as part of the SEL1:SYVN1:DERL2 retrotranslocon, the details, order of events and even the full complement of protein players in this process are not known. In yeast, the VCP homologue Cdc48 is associated with two additional proteins Ufd1 and Npl4 -both of which are also conserved in mammals- and this complex interacts with several ER components including derlins and the yeast SYVN1 homologue, Hrd1 (reviewed in Vembar and Brodsky, 2009). Consistent with the yeast data, VCP interacts with DERL2 by co-immunoprecipitation in HEK293 cells (Huang et al, 2013).	ERLEC1__OS9;DER2__SEL1L
2014	8	binds	Promotion of the cholesterol-mediated autocleavage reaction is the only well documented role for the C-terminal region of intact Hh (reviewed in Briscoe and Therond, 2013), and recent in vitro studies suggest that the Hh-C fragment generated by autocleavage is subsequently targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway (Chen et al, 2011; Huang et al, 2013). This pathway delivers N-glycosylated ER-resident substrates to a retrotranslocation channel, where they are ubiquitinated and translocated to the cytosol for proteasome-mediated degradation in an ATP-ase dependent fashion (reviewed in Vembar and Brodsky, 2008). Recognition and targettng of ER proteins for the ERAD pathway depends at least in part on modification and binding of the glycosyl groups. Consistent with this, depletion of the lectins OS9 and ERLEC1 abrogates degradation of the Hh-C fragments (Chen et al, 2011). OS9 and ERLEC1 may target Hh-C to the retrotranslocation channel by virtue of their interaction with SEL1, an ER membrane protein with established roles in the ERAD pathway (Christianson et al, 2008; Mueller et al, 2008; Hosokawa et al, 2008; Hosokawa et al, 2009).

The C-terminal region of IRAK-1 contains three potential TRAF6-binding sites; mutation of the amino acids (Glu544, Glu587, Glu706) in these sites to alanine greatly reduces activation of NFkappaB (Ye et al. 2002).

2008	8	binds	Docking and priming of clathrin sculpted acetylcholine loaded transport vesicle occurs once the synaptic vesicle has moved from the cytoplasm to a region apposed to the plasma membrane. The details of the docking and priming reaction have been worked out using synaptic vesicles loaded with glutamate and similar reactions may occur during the transport cycle of acetylcholine. The vesicle is held in close apposition to the plasma membrane by several proteins that bridge the synaptic vesicle to the plasma membrane. Some of these proteins are in the plasma membrane while others are in the synaptic vesicle. Vesicle fusion is preceded by a priming event where molecular interactions between the docked vesicle and the plasma membrane undergo changes. The molecules in the docking and the priming process are known, however, the exact sequence and the precise molecular changes involved in docking and priming are not well dissected. In this reaction the process of docking and priming has been condensed. It is known that Munc18 along with its interactors is critical for membrane docking and fusion events while Munc 13 along with its interacting proteins is central to priming. Munc 13 could act as a positive regulator for the priming recation. Finally the primed fusion complex is clamped in the pre-fusion form by a Complexin. Complexins are Ca2+ independent cytosolic proteins that bind to partly or fully assembled SNARE complexes. Complexins play both a positive and a negative role in the release process.<br>	SNAP25;STX1A

2013	8	binds	DACT1, also known as DAPPER1, was identified in Xenopus as a negative regulator of WNT canonical and non-canonical signaling. In Xenopus, DACT1 has been shown to form a complex with GSK3beta, AXIN, CSNK1 and beta-catenin when co-expressed in HEK293 cells with DVL, and expression of DACT1 negatively regulates expression of beta-catenin target genes (Cheyette et al, 2002). In human cells, DACT1 co-precipitates with DVL2, an interaction mediated by the DIX domain of DVL2 and the C-terminal region of DACT1. siRNA depletion of DACT1 results in higher expression of beta-catenin dependent reporters and increased protein levels of DVL2, suggesting that DACT1 restricts beta-catenin-dependent signaling by promoting the degradation of DVL2. Consistent with this, lysosome inhibitors block DACT1-induced degradation of DVL2 (Zhang et al, 2006).	DVL2;HNG3

2008	8	binds	The structurally related (70% identity) orphan G-protein-coupled receptors, neuropeptides B/W receptor 1 and 2 (GPR7 and GPR8 respectively) (O'Dowd BF et al, 1995), are wideley expressed in the central nervous system of humans. Natural ligands identified for these receptors are involved in the regulation of feeding. Neuropeptide B is cleaved into two chains; NPB23 (L7) and NPB29 (L7C). Neuropeptide W is also cleaved into two chains; NPW23 (L8) and NPW30 (L8C) (Tanaka H et al, 2003). Both these peptides can bind to either GPR7 or 8 to elicit their effects downstream.

2012	8	binds	A variety of inhibitors capable of blocking the phosphoinositide kinase activity of PI3K have been developed. These inhibitors display differential selectivity and inhibit kinase activity of their substrates by distinct mechanisms. For example, the first-generation PI3K inhibitor wortmannin (Wymann et al. 1996) covalently and irreversibly binds all classes of PI3K enzymes, as well as other kinases including mTOR, at a residue critical for catalytic activity. Although wortmannin is precluded from in vivo and clinical use due to its toxicity, it has proven to be a useful tool for in vitro laboratory studies. Newer inhibitors, such as BEZ235, are currently being investigated in Phase I clinical trials. BEZ235 is a dual pan-class I PI3K/mTOR inhibitor that blocks kinase activity by binding competitively to the ATP-binding pocket of these enzymes (Serra et al. 2008, Maira et al. 2008). BGT226 (Chang et al. 2011) and XL765 (Prasad et al. 2011) also inhibits both PI3K class I enzymes and mTOR. Other inhibitors in clinical trials, such as BKM120 (Maira et al. 2012), GDC0941 (Folkes et al. 2008, Junttila et al. 2009) and XL147 (Chakrabarty et al. 2012), are specific for class I PI3Ks and exhibit no activity against mTOR. Current research aims to identify isoform-specific PI3K inhibitors. Small molecule inhibitors that selectively inhibit PIK3CA (p110alpha), e.g. PIK-75 and A66, were used to study the role of p110alpha in signaling and growth of tumor cells (Knight et al. 2006, Sun et al. 2010, Jamieson et al. 2011, Utermark et al. 2012). The PIK3CB (p110beta) specific inhibitor TGX221 has been used in in vitro models of vascular injury (Jackson et al. 2005), and the TGX221 derivative KIN-193 has been shown to block AKT activity and tumor growth in mice with p110beta activation or PTEN loss (Ni et al. 2012). CAL-101 is a PIK3CD (p110delta) specific inhibitor that is being clinically investigated as a therapeutic for lymphoid malignancies (Herman et al. 2010). It is hoped that, in the future, more specific inhibitors, such as those targeting selective PI3K isoforms, will provide optimum treatment while minimizing unwanted side effects.

The CAM homology domain (CHD) in the FGFR, which resides between Ig like domains 1 and 2, interacts with the putative FGFR-CHD binding motif in the Fn3 module 4 of L1. This interaction leads to activation of the tyrosine kinase domain of the FGFR and subsequent activation of PLCgamma. PLCgamma then hydrolyses PIP2 to generate IP3 and DAG which finally leads to an increase in localized Ca+2 influx and activation of Ca+2/Calmodulin kinase II.	L1;FGFR1c

2008	8	binds	CCR9 (previously called orphan receptor GPR 9-6) is highly expressed in the thymus on both mature and immature T-cells. It is also abundant in T-cells of the intestine but is lowly expressed in lymph nodes and the spleen. Alternative splicing produces two receptors, called CCR9A and CCR9B, CCR9A containing 12 additional amino acids at its N terminus as compared with CCR9B (Yu CR et al, 2000). The A and B forms of the receptor were expressed at a ratio of approximately 10:1. CCR9 has a specific ligand in CCL25 (Thymus-expressed chemokine, TECK) (Zaballos A et al, 1999) and transduces the signal by intracellular calcium mobilization.	TECK;CCR9

2010	8	binds	MHC class I heterodimers are only stable in peptide bound form and only as a trimer (with bound peptide) present on the cell surface. Class I MHC molecules prefer nonapeptides, and less frequently use octa- or deca-peptides. The peptide binding groove in MHC class I molecules is formed by the intimate association of the alpha1 and alpha2 domains of the heavy chain. Structural studies have revealed that the alpha1:alpha2 domains form a single peptide binding groove consisting of 2 parallel helices on a floor of 8 beta-strands. Hydrogen bonding networks are established in the binding groove with the antigenic peptide main chain and terminal atoms that enable largely sequence independent ligation. Upon peptide binding the class I MHC molecule releases from the peptide loading complex (PLC) and clusters at ER exit sites and is finally exported to the cell surface.<br>MHC I molecules bound to low-affinity peptides are not transferred to the cell surface and are instead cycled back to ER. They can proceed to the cell surface only when they become bound to high-affinity peptide (Howe et al, 2009; Garstka et al, 2007). Calreticulin binds to these low-affinity peptide bound class I molecules and mediate the retrieval from golgi apparatus to ER and for effcient presentation of a model antigen (Howe et al, 2009).

2006	8	binds	By analogy to the process described for botulinum toxin type A (Koriazova and Montal 2003; Montal 2010), acidification, a normal step in synaptic vesicle recycling, is inferred to cause a conformational change in the botulinum toxin type F disulfide-bonded heavy chain - light chain heterodimer (BoNT/F HC:LC) it contains, allowing the HC part of the toxin to function as a channel through which its LC part is extruded into the neuronal cytosol.The HC - LC disulfide bond is cleaved.

2012	8	binds	Microfibrils are composed largely of fibrillin but also contain covalently-linked microfibril associated glycoproteins MAGP-1 (MFAP2) and MAGP-2 (MFAP5). MFAP2 is a structural component of almost all vertebrate microfibrils (Gibson et al. 1989, Trask et al. 2000, Jensen et al. 2001). It appears to be important for tissue development and/or homeostasis, including regulation of bone remodelling and deposition of tissue fat (Weinbaum et al. 2008). The C-terminal half of MFAP2 is rich in cysteines and contains a matrix-binding domain that facilitates interactions with fibrillin (Weinbaum et al. 2008). The related MFAP5 similarly binds to microfibrils (Gibson et al. 1998) but with a restricted expression profile.	MFAP5__MFAP2;Fibrillin-2__Fibrillin-3__Fibrillin-1

2007	8	binds	Alpha5beta1 integrin was the first integrin shown to bind fibronectin (FN1). Unlike other FN1-binding integrins it is a specialist at this task. In solution FN1 occurs as a dimer. Binding to alpha5beta1 integrin stimulates FN1 self-association; blocking the RGD-cell binding domain of FN1 blocks fibril formation (Fogerty et al. 1990). FN1 binding is believed to induce integrin clustering, which promotes FN1-FN1 interactions. Integrin clustering is mediated by association between integrins and intracellular actin stress fibers (Calderwood et al. 2000). Binding of integrins to each of the monomers in the FN1 dimer pair is thought to trigger a conformational change in FN1 that exposes 'cryptic' FN1 binding sites that allow additional fibronectin dimers to bind without the requirement for pre-association with integrins (Singh et al. 2010). This non-covalent interaction may involve interactions with fibrillin (Ohashi & Erickson 2009). I1-5 functions as a unit that is the primary FN matrix assembly domain (Sottile et al. 1991) but other units are likely to be involved (Singh et al. 2010). Other integrins able to bind FN1 include alphaIIbBeta3, which is highly expressed on platelets where it predominantly binds fibrinogen leading to thrombus formation but also binds FN1 (Savage et al. 1996). Alpha4beta1 mediates cell-cell contacts and cell-matrix contacts through the ligands VCAM-1 and FN1, respectively (Humphries et al. 1995). Integrins alpha3beta1, alpha4beta7, alphaVbeta1, 3 (Johansson et al. 1997), 6 (Busk et al. 1992) and alpha8beta1 (Muller et al. 1995, Farias et al. 2005) are all able to bind FN1. <br><br>Tenacious binding of free fibronectin to cells leads to enhanced fibronectin matrix assembly and the formation of a polymerized fibronectin "cocoon" around the cells.

2007	8	binds	The nascent vRNP complexes, one for each gene segment, contain the negative-sense viral RNA and polymerase proteins (PB1, PB2, PA, and NP). In a model using negative-sense viral RNP reconstituted from transfected cells, there are multiple NP complexes and one polymerase complex arranged along a closed vRNA loop (Area et al., 2004). The three-dimensional structure of NP has revealed that three NP molecules form a stable trimer, interacting through beta-sheets b5, b6, and b7 in the C-terminal domain of the protein (Ye, 2006), with the viral RNA wrapping around the outside of the complex. Viral RNA from purified virions is present in an RNase-sensitive complex with NP and PB1, PB2, and PA, consistent with this structural model (Baudin et al, 1994; Ruigrok et al., 1995; Klumpp et al., 1997). It is not clear what controls the fate of vRNP, whether it is destined to become a template for transcription, for replication, or for export into the cytoplasm for packaging into virions at the plasma membrane, nor how distinct sub-nuclear localization and NP distribution at the nuclear matrix might mark, or polarize, a vRNP for export (Elton, 2005; Takizawa et al., 2006).

2009	8	binds	The classical view of G-protein signalling is that the G-protein alpha subunit dissociates from the beta:gamma dimer. Activated G alpha (s) and the beta:gamma dimer then participate in separate signaling cascades. Although G protein dissociation has been contested (e.g. Bassi et al. 1996), recent in vivo experiments have demonstrated that dissociation does occur, though possibly not to completion (Lambert 2008).

2004	8	binds	The U7 snRNP. This particle contains the U7 snRNA, the smallest of the snRNAs which varies from 57-70 nts long depending on the species. The 5Ã¢â¬â¢ end of U7 snRNA binds to a sequence 3Ã¢â¬â¢ of the stemloop, termed the histone downstream element (HDE). There are a number of proteins found in the U7 snRNP. There are 7 Sm proteins, as are present in the spliceosomal snRNP. Five of these proteins are the same as ones found in the spliceosomal snRNPs and there are 2, Lsm10 and Lsm11 that are unique to U7 snRNP. A third protein joins the U7 snRNP, ZFP100, a large zinc finger protein. ZFP100 interacts with SLBP bound to the histone pre-mRNA and with Lsm11 and likely plays a critical role in recruiting U7 snRNP to the histone pre-mRNA.	SLBP;ZNF473
2013	8	binds	Decorin (DCN) belongs to the small leucine-rich repeat proteoglycan family (SLRPs) which also includes biglycan, fibromodulin (Hedlund et al. 1994 - binding to collagen II), lumican and asporin (Hedbom & Heinegard 1993, Ezura et al. 2000). Fibromodulin and lumican bind the same site while the binding site for decorin is distinct (Hedbom & Heinegard 1993). All appear to be involved in collagen fibril formation and matrix assembly (Ameye & Young 2002, Kalamajski & Oldberg 2010). DCN consists of a core protein of approximately 40 kDa attached to a single chondroitin or dermatan sulfate glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chain. It interacts with collagen types I, II (Vogel et al. 1984), III (Witos et al. 2011), V (Whinna et al. 1993), VI (Bidanset et al. 1992) and XIV (Ehnis et al. 1997). It binds collagen I and II near the N-terminus, placing it at the 'd' band gap in the fibril structure (Kalamajski et al. 2007). The binding site for DCN on collagen XIV is in the NH2-terminal fibronectin type III repeat. In addition, an auxiliary binding site located COOH-terminally to this fibronectin type III repeat interacts with the glycosaminoglycan component of DCN. DCN binding regulates fibrillogenesis (Vogel et al. 1984, Orgel et al. 2006). One molecule of DCN interacts with four to six collagen molecules. The interaction is between collagen and the core protein, not the GAG chain, and is more likely to involve the monomeric, not dimeric form (Orgel et al. 2009). Fibronectin (Winnemoller et al. 1991) and thrombospondin-1 (Winnemoller et al. 1992) are also DCN interactors. DCN acts as a sink for all three isoforms of TGF-Beta, binding them when already bound to collagen (Markmann et al. 2000). Degradation of DCN by matrix metalloproteinases MMP-2, -3 or -7 results in release of TGF-beta (Imai et al. 1997). In addition, DCN binds to EGFR (Iozzo et al. 1999) causing prolonged down-regulation of EGFR-mediated mobilization of intracellular calcium (Csordás et al. 2000).

2011	8	binds	TAD and PEST domains of NOTCH intracellular domain contain multiple conserved cyclin-dependent kinase phosphorylation sites. In vitro, recombinant human CDK8 in complex with recombinant human cyclin C (CDK8:CCNC) readily phosphorylates recombinant Xenopus NICD1 (xNICD1). This phosphorylation also occurs when these recombinant proteins are expressed in HeLa cells, and was directly shown to involve conserved serine residues in the PEST domain. Phosphorylation by CDK8 targets xNICD1 for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation, thereby coordinating NICD1 transcriptional activity with NICD1 turnover.	PCAF__GCN5;p300

2012	8	binds	Although phosphorylation of activated rhodopsin (MII) reduces transducin activation, complete deactivation occurs only after arrestin (S-antigen or SAG, Yamaki et al. 1988) binds to and sterically caps MII. SAG is capable of binding unphosphorylated MII, but with very low probability. Binding affinity increases greatly upon phosphorylation. Binding of SAG generally occurs after MII has been phosphorylated ~3 times, and binding prevents further phosphorylation. Interestingly, rods express a small amount of a splice variant of SAG, P44, but its function is not yet known. Defects in SAG cause Oguchi type 1 disease (CSNBO1; MIM:258100), a recessive form of congenital stationary night blindness characterized by impaired scotopic vision (Fuchs et al. 1995).	SAG;RHO
2009	8	binds	The CRB3âPals1âPATJ complex is the second major cell polarity protein complex at Tight Junctions (TJs) (Shin et al., 2006). The integral membrane protein CRB3 localizes to the apical domain of epithelial cells and is concentrated at TJs. CRB3 directly associates with Pals1 which interacts with PATJ, a proteins consisting of 10 PDZ domains. The interaction with CRB3 might recruit the Pals1-PATJ complex to TJs (Lemmers et al., 2002; Roh et al., 2003). Although its precise functions of the individual components have not been established, the complex is required for TJ formation, in part through the stabilization of apical and lateral components of tight junctions (Michel et al., 2005; Shin et al., 2005).

2007	8	binds	Viral genomic RNA (vRNA) and complementary RNA (cRNA) are likely bound by the influenza nucleoprotein (NP) immediately upon synthesis. Although two nuclear localization signals have been mapped in the NP, an unconventional N-terminal NLS and a bipartite NLS within amino acids 198-216 (Wang, 1997; Neumann, 1997; Ozawa, 2007), the crystal structure of the NP suggests that only the unconventional NLS is exposed and can be used as a functional NLS (Ye, 2006). This unconvenetional NLS interacts with importins alpha-1 and -2 (Cros et al., 2005; Wang et al., 1997; Buolo et al., 2006). The three-dimensional structure of NP has revealed that NP molecules associate as a trimer, interacting through beta-sheets b5, b6, and b7 in the C-terminal domain of the protein; the viral RNA likely wraps around the outside of the complex (Ye, 2006).

Packages of accumulated elastin are delivered to fibrillin-based fibres in a mechanism that is correlated with cell migration during embryonic development (Czirok et al. 2006). A transglutaminase cross-link between domain 4 of tropoelastin and domain 16 of fibrillin-1 (FBN1) may stabilize initial deposition (Clarke et al. 2005).

The specificity and efficiency of this process has been demonstrated through a variety of studies in tissue culture model systems (Rigotti et al. 2003; Silver and Tall 2001). The process is annotated here as a concerted event occuring at the cell surface but its molecular details remain incompletely defined and it is possible that the HDL particle is internalized while undergoing disassembly.

2014	8	binds	MTRF1L (mtRF1a) binds the stop codons UAA and UAG of the mRNA when they are in the A site of the ribosome (Soleimanpour-Lichaei 2007, Nozaki et al. 2008). (The UGA codon is recognized by the tryptophan tRNA in mitochondrial translation.) MTRF1 was also thought to play a role in translation termination by recognizing the unconventional termination codons AGA and AGG (Zhang and Spremulli 1998, Young et al. 2010) but frameshifting is now confirmed in the termination mechanism of these codons (Temperley et al. 2010). Structural features of MTRF1 have been reported suggesting it could recognize an empty A-site (Huynen et al. 2012) or UAA and UAG codons (Lind et al. 2013) however there is no direct experimental data to confirm these last two postulates.

2004	8	binds	The 85kDa cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2 - PLA2G4A) is involved in cell signalling processes and inflammatory response and is regulated by phosphorylation and calcium concentrations. cPLA2 is phosphorylated at Ser727 and by a MAPK at Ser505. When phosphorylation is coupled with an influx of calcium ions, PLA2 becomes stimulated and translocates to the membrane where it releases arachidonic acid (AA) from membrane phospholipids. Calcium does not itself activate cPLA2. cPLA2 contains an N-terminal calcium-dependent phospholipid binding domain (CaLB) which shares homology with C2 domains (plays roles in signal transduction and membrane trafficking) and binds it to the membrane. Arachidonic acid is both a signalling molecule and the precursor for other signalling molecules termed eicosanoids (e.g., prostaglandins, leukotrienes and platelet-activating factor). A strict regulation of the activity of phospholipase enzyme is essential.	PC;Ca2+

As with other types of vesicles the cargo itself is part of the vesicle development. Here the cargo is destined for the lysosome membrane. It is at this stage that a specific Synaptobrevin (Vamp) molecule also joins the complex. It should be noted that only certain Vamp molecules will be found with specific cargo molecules on the newly forming vesicles. However here we represent this reaction in bulk, without specific Vamp and cargo molecule pairings.	M6PR__BLOC1S1;GNS__CTSZ__TXNDC5__DNASE2

VHL constitutively shuttles between the cytosol and nucleoplasm (Lewis and Roberts 2003) and though the VHL:HIF-alpha complex is predominantly nuclear, binding and degradation can occur in both the cytosol and the nucleus (Berra et al. 2001).	2xHP-HIF1A__HP-HIF3A__HIF2A;RBX1__CUL2

2012	8	binds	NTAL cooperates with LAT in mast cells to activate PI3K pathway and cytokine production through Grb2-associated binding protein 2 (GAB2) (Gonzalez-Espinosa et al. 2003). FCERI aggregation induced translocation of a significant fraction of GAB2 from the cytosol to the plasma membrane by binding GRB2. Two of the proline-rich motifs in GAB2 are binding sites for the SH3 of GRB2. GAB2 is also recruited to plasma membrane by binding to phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) with its plecstrin homology (PH) domain. GAB2 can be recruited to FCERI indirectly through GRB2 bound SHC1. SHC1 is recruited to the FCERI beta chain through its SH2 domain and becomes tyrosyl-phosphorylated. Phosphorylated SHC provides a docking site for the GRB2 and this in turn recruits GAB2 (Yu et al. 2006). GAB2 and PI3K are required for FCERI-induced granule translocation.	p-10Y-LAT2;GAB2
2012	8	binds	Gads/GRAP2 (GRB2-related adapter protein 2) is member of the GRB2 adaptor family with a central SH2 domain and linker region flanked by amino- and carboxy-terminal SH3 domains. SLP-76 associates constitutively via its central 20-amino acid proline-rich domain with the C-terminal SH3 domain of Gads, which recruits it to LAT following receptor stimulation. Upon LAT phosphorylation, Gads:SLP-76 complex principally binds to phosphorylated LAT tyrosine 191, with a reduced amount of binding to phosphorylated tyrosine 171 and no interaction with phosphorylated tyrosines 132 or 226 (Houtman et al. 2004, Zhu et al. 2003). Gads may promote cross-talk between the LAT and SLP-76 signaling complexes, thereby coupling membrane-proximal events to downstream signaling pathways (Liu et al. 1999). The LAT-Gads-SLP-76 complex creates a platform for the recruitment of multiple signaling molecules, including PLCgamma1, GRB2, NCK, Rho GEFs, VAV and the Tec-family kinases ITK and BTK (Liu et al. 1999 & 2001, Asada et al. 1999, Yablonski et al. 2001).

2014	8	binds	The FRAT genes, which were initially identified as a target of Frequent Rearrangement in Advanced T-cell lymphoma, encode potent activators of canonical WNT signaling and are highly conserved in vertebrates. Xenopus and zebrafish each have one FRAT gene, while the human and mouse genomes contains two and three, respectively (Jonkers et al, 1997; reviewed in van Amerongen and Berns, 2005). Frat proteins activate WNT signaling by binding to GSK3beta and inhibiting its phosphorylation of beta-catenin (Yost et al, 1998; van Amerongen et al, 2004). The interaction with GSK3beta is mediated by a highly conserved IKEA box in the C-terminal domain of FRAT (Yost et al, 1998; van Amerongen et al, 2004; Thomas et al, 1999). This region of FRAT is able to compete with AXIN for binding to GSK3beta, suggesting a model where FRAT is able to destabilize the destruction complex by abrogating the GSK3beta-AXIN interaction (Farr et al, 2000; Thomas et al, 1999; Fraser at el, 2002; Ferkey et al, 2002). This model is supported by structural studies showing that AXIN and FRAT bind to the same region on the surface of GSK3beta (Bax et al, 2001; Dajani et al, 2003). Endogenous FRAT1 has also been shown to interact with DVL3, and this reaction persists in a FRAT1 mutant lacking the GSK3beta-interacting domain (Li et al, 1999). FRAT proteins may thus help bridge between GSK3betas role in the destruction complex and its role in activating signaling in response to WNT.<br><br>Despite the apparent importance of FRAT proteins in beta-catenin-dependent signaling, a triple FRAT knockout mouse shows no readily evident defects in canonical signaling and, unlike the GBP knockout in Xenopus, no overt phenotypic defects (van Amerongen et al, 2005; Yost et al, 1989). The in vivo role and significance of the FRAT proteins in WNT signaling remains to be resolved; it is worth noting, however, that FRAT proteins have also recently been shown to be involved in non-canonical WNT signaling in a GSK3beta-independent manner. It is possible that it is through this non-canonical role that FRAT proteins contribute to oncogenesis (van Amerongen et al, 2010; Walf-Vorderwülbecke et al, 2012).	GSK3B;FRAT1__FRAT2

SMARCA4 or SMARCA2 are the catalytic ATPase subunits. SMARCC1 and SMARCC2 are 62% identical to each other at the protein level (Wang et al. 1996). Loss of the SMARCB1 subunit (SWI/SNF-related matrix associated actin dependent regulator of chromatin B1) is a recurrent genetic characteristic of malignant rhabdoid tumor (MRT), a rare and aggressive pediatric cancer (Versteege et al. 1998, Biegel et al.1999).

2012	8	binds	Calcineurin (CaN), also called protein phosphatase 2B (PP2B), is a calcium/Calmodulin (CaM)-dependent serine/threonine protein phosphatase. It exists as a heterodimer consisting of CaM-binding catalytic subunit CaN A chain and a Ca+2 binding regulatory CaN B chain. At low calcium concentrations, CaN exists in an inactive state, where the autoinhibitory domain (AID) binds to the active-site cleft. Upon an increase in calcium concentration CaM binds to Ca+2 ions and gets activated. Active CaM binds to CaN regulatory domain (RD) and this causes release of the AID and activation of the phosphatase (Rumi-Masante et al. 2012). Binding of calcium to CaN B regulatory chain also causes a conformational change of the RD of CaN A chain (Yang & Klee 2000).	Ca2+__CALM1;Ca2+

2008	8	binds	Bombesin-like receptors are widely distributed in the CNS as well as in the GI tract where they modulate smooth-muscle contraction, exocrine and endocrine processes, metabolism, and behaviour through the binding of bombesin-like peptides.

BRS-3 binds bombesin peptides with low affinity and is often classed as an orphan receptor. There are two homologues of bombesin-like peptides; Gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) (Sausville EA et al, 1986) and Neuromedin-B (NMB) (Krane IM et al, 1988).

2006	8	binds	hTERC is transcribed as a precursor and is processed at its 3' end to yield a 451 nucleotide RNA (Zaug et al. 1996). The accumulation of hTERC that has undergone this processing event requires a conserved region of sequence termed the box H/ACA motif (Mitchell et al. 1999a). This motif is bound by a complex containing dyskerin, and mutations in dyskerin affect the processing and accumulation of hTERC (Mitchell et al. 1999b; Mitchell and Collins 2000; Fu and Collins 2003). Recent studies of purified, catalytically active telomerase indicate that the minimal structure that has telomerase activity in vitro is a complex of one molecule of hTERC RNA and two each of hTERT and DKC1 (dyskerin) proteins (Cohen et al. 2007). Several additional proteins may associate with this minimal complex and modulate its activity. RUVBL1 (pontin), RUVBL2 (reptin), and TCAB1 (telomere Cajal body protein 1) are found associated with human telomerase RNPs purified from HeLa cells, and activities of these proteins are required for telomerase RNP assembly in vivo (Venteicher et al. 2008, 2009). NHP2 (NOLA2) is likewise associated with telomerase ribonucleoprotein complexes (Pogacic et al. 2000) and homozygosity for NHP2 mutations is associated with telomerase failure (dyskeratosis congenita) in humans (Vuillamy et al. 2008). The exact roles of the additional proteins in the assembly and function of telomerase RNP in vivo remain unclear, however, so they are annotated simply as positively regulating telomerase RNP formation.<br><br><br>The core components hTERC and hTERT undergo trafficking in the cell that may be important for telomerase function. hTERC has been found localized in multiple nuclear structures, including Cajal bodies, nucleoli, and at telomeres (Mitchell et al. 1999a; Jady et al. 2004; Zhu et al. 2004; Jady et al. 2006; Tomlinson et al. 2006). hTERT is also reported localize in Cajal bodies, nucleoli, and to associate with telomeres (Etheridge et al. 2002; Wong et al. 2002; Yang et al. 2002; Zhu et al. 2004; Tomlinson et al. 2006). Some of the factors that regulate trafficking of these two core components of telomerase have been identified, such as nucleolin (Khurts et al. 2004), SMN (Bachand et al. 2002), and 14-3-3 (Seimiya et al. 2000). Cytological studies of HeLa cells suggest that the localization of the telomerase core components can change through the cell-cycle (Jady et al. 2006; Tomlinson et al. 2006). Despite these studies, it is not clear in which compartment hTERT and hTERC assemble to form functional telomerase RNP.<br><br><br>The assembly of telomerase involves the chaperone proteins p23 and Hsp90, which stably associate with telomerase in vitro (Holt et al. 1999; Forsythe et al. 2001; Keppler et al. 2006). A number of other proteins interact with the telomerase RNP, but it is not clear if they play a role in telomerase assembly. Interestingly, assembled human telomerase RNP can multimerize, though the function of multimerization remains unclear (Beattie et al. 2001; Wenz et al. 2001; Arai et al. 2002).

2012	8	binds	Transforming growth factor (TGF) beta (TGF-beta) is a family of three cytokine 'isoforms' (encoded by three separate human genes) that control proliferation, cellular differentiation and other functions. TGF-beta originally referred to the founding member TGF-beta-1, now it is often used as a collective term for all three. TGF-beta is secreted from cells in latent form as part of a complex that includes two other proteins: the cleaved propeptide of TGF beta, known as latency associated peptide (LAP), and a member of the latent TGF beta binding protein (LTBP) family. LTBPs are members of the fibrillin/LTBP superfamily, characterised by the presence of unique TGF-binding protein (TB) domains, also known as 8 cys domains as they contain eight characteristic cysteines (Ramirez & Sakai 2010). LTBPs are microfibril-associated, proteins that tether latent complexes of TGF-beta to microfibrils in the ECM (Taipale et al. 1996, Dallas et al. 2000, Isogai et al. 2003, Hyytiainen et al. 2004, Ono et al. 2009, Munger & Sheppard 2011). LTBP1 and 3 bind all three isoforms of latent TGF-beta, while LTBP4 only weakly binds TGF-beta1 (Saharinen & Keski Oja 2000). LTBP2 does not bind TGF-beta and is a structural component of fibrillin microfibrils. The carboxyl terminus of LTBP1 binds to fibrillin-1. LTBP1 and LTBP4 incorporation into the ECM is abolished in fibrillin-1 null mice (Ono et al. 2009). The amino terminus of LTBPs binds ECM components such as collagen (Taipale et al. 1996) and fibronectin (Kantola et al. 2008). Fibulins compete for the LTBP sites in fibrillin (Ono et al. 2009).

LTBPs are microfibril (fibrillin)-associated proteins that bind LAP, tethering latent TGF-beta to microfibrils in the ECM (Taipale et al. 1996, Hyytiainen et al. 2004). LTBP1 and LTBP4 incorporation into ECM requires fibrillin-1 (Ono et al. 2009). The proteinprotein interaction sites between LTBPs and fibrillins have been determined using recombinant protein fragments and surface plasmon resonance (Ono et al. 2009). LTBP4 binds to the first hybrid domain of fibrillin-1 (Hyb1), whereas LTBP1 binds to a site involving both Hyb1 and adjacent EGF-like domains 2 and 3. Previous studies showed that the carboxyl terminus of LTBP1 binds to fibrillin-1, whereas the amino terminus of LTBPs is mainly responsible for binding ECM components made in cell culture generally, and fibronectin specifically (Kantola et al. 2008).

Upon feeding glucose levels rise and in response to this the body secretes insulin from pancreatic beta-cells into the blood. At physiological concentrations insulin is present in the blood in its monomeric form. Binding of insulin to its receptor occurs on the receptor alpha-subunits. There are two binding domains involved on the receptor (L1 and L2) and it is thought that the amino-terminus of insulin binds with L1 on one of the alpha-subunits and the carboxyterminus with L2 on the other alpha-subunit.<p>The binding of insulin to its receptor causes a conformational change in the alpha-subunits.

Formation of this complex was confirmed by both co-immunoprecipitation of the endogenous complex from the human keratinocyte cell line HaCat and by protein interaction studies using tagged recombinant proteins. It is possible that cells contain pre-assembled cytosolic complexes of SMAD2/3, RBL1 (p107) and E2F4/5, that translocate to the nucleus after TGF-beta stimulation, when phosphorylated SMAD2/3 recruit SMAD4. The MH2 domain of SMAD3 establishes independent contacts with the N-termini of E2F4 (or E2F5) and unphosphorylated RBL1 (p107). RBL2 (p130), RB1 and E2F1 do not interact with SMAD2/3 (Chen et al. 2002).	TFDP1, TFDP2__RBL1__E2F4/5;p-2S-SMAD2/3__SMAD4

Two of the proline-rich motifs in GAB2 are binding sites for the SH3 of GRB2. GAB2 is also recruited to plasma membrane by binding to phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) with its plecstrin homology (PH) domain. GAB2 can be recruited to FCERI indirectly through GRB2 bound SHC1. SHC1 is recruited to the FCERI beta chain through its SH2 domain and becomes tyrosyl-phosphorylated. Phosphorylated SHC provides a docking site for the GRB2 and this in turn recruits GAB2 (Yu et al. 2006). GAB2 and PI3K are required for FCERI-induced granule translocation.	PIP3;p-10Y-LAT2

2007	8	binds	Recruitment of PLC-gamma by FGF receptors has been best studied in FGFR1c signaling, where it has been shown that autophosphorylation of Tyr766 in the C-terminal tail of FGFR1c creates a specific binding site for the SH2 domain of PLC-gamma. A mutant FGFR1c in which Y766 is replaced by phenylalanine is unable to activate PI hydrolysis and Ca2+ release in response to FGF stimulation. Membrane recruitment of PLC-gamma is also aided by binding of the Pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of this enzyme to PtIns(3,4,5) P3 molecules that are generated in response to PI-3 kinase stimulation. By sequence comparison, Y766 is conserved in all FGFR isoforms, and PLC-gamma signaling is observed, to a greater or lesser extent, downstream of all FGFR receptors upon stimulation with FGFs.

2012	8	binds	VAV2 and VAV3 are expressed in human NK cells and play a central role in NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity. They are required for DAP12-mediated signaling; their loss profoundly impairs DAP12-induced cytotoxicity (Billadeau et al. 2000, Cella et al. 2004). Phosphorylated SLP-76 tyrosines Y113 and Y128 provide binding sites for the SH2 domains of VAV. The binding of VAV to these phosphotyrosine residues may link SLP-76 to the Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway and the actin cytoskeleton. Y145 has been implicated in the binding of SLP-76 to the Tec family kinase BTK (Kettner et al. 2003). BTK is required for secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and PLCgamma and Ca2+ mobilization (Ormsby et al. 2011).	PIP3;VAV2__VAV3

2012	8	binds	Mast cells express four out of five Tec family members (i.e. BTK, ITK, RLK and TEC) and are activated upon cross-linking of FCERI. They are recruited to the membrane via the interaction of their PH domain with PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 phosphate and their SH2 domain with Y145 of SLP-76 (Kettner et al. 2003). BTK is more important for early response such as phosphorylation of PLC-gamma2 and Ca2+ mobilization, whereas ITK regulates the late responses such as changes in gene expression and cytokine secretion. BTK deficient mice have mild defects in degranulation and severe impairments in the production of proinflammatory cytokines upon FCERI cross-linking (Hata et al. 1998). ITK deficient mice have been reported to have reduced MC degranulation and responses to allergic asthma (Forssell et al. 2005). However, Bone marrow derived mast cells (BMMC) derived from ITK deficient mice display a normal degranulation response but secrete elevated level of cytokines (TNFa and IL-13) (Iyer & August 2008). TEC kinase is also one of the crucial regulators of murine mast cell function. TEC is phosphorylated and activated upon FCERI stimulation. TEC deficient bone marrow derived mast cells did not show any in vitro or in vivo defects in histamine release. However, the generation of the leukotriene LTC4 was severely impaired in the absence of TEC (Schmidt et al. 2009).	PIP3;TEC__TXK__ITK__BTK

2004	8	binds	CaMKIV becomes fully activated after a three-step mechanism: Upon a transient increase in intracellular calcium, calcium-bound calmodulin (Ca2+/CaM) binds to its autoregulatory domain, which relieves intersteric inhibition. An activating protein kinase, calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase (CaMKK), binds to the Ca2+/CaM:CaMKIV complex and phosphorylates CaMKIV on a threonine residue in the activation loop. After full activation by the three-step mechanism mentioned above, the activity of CaMKIV becomes autonomous and no longer requires bound Ca2+/CaM. This activity is required for CaMKIV-mediated transcriptional regulation. The CaMKIV-associated PP2A then dephosphorylates CaMKIV, thereby terminating autonomous activity and CaMKIV-mediated gene transcription.	CAMK4;Ca2+__CALM1

2011	8	binds	Peptides generated by Cathepsin S or IRAP-mediated proteolysis in the endosomes are loaded onto MHC class I molecules, which are internalized and transported to early and late endosomal compartments where antigenic peptides can be loaded. A fraction of the internalized cell surface class I molecules enter MHC class II compartments (MIICs) within endocytic vesicles (Gromme et al. 1999, Kleijmeer et al. 2001). Microscopic analysis has revealed that surface MHC-I molecules are internalized and transported to early and late endosomal compartments (Basha et al. 2008, Lizee et al. 2003). A tyrosine-based endocytic trafficking motif (YXXA) is required for the constitutive internalization of MHC-I molecules from the cell surface into early/late endosomes for peptide loading (Basha et al. 2008, Lizee et al. 2003). Upon entry in to these endosomal compartments the MHC class I complexes exchange their pre-bound peptides with exogenously derived antigenic peptides.

2007	8	binds	As influenza viruses bud from the plasma membrane of infected cells, complete virions are not seen inside cells. In polarized epithelial cells, assembly and budding of influenza occurs from the apical plasma membrane (Schmitt, 2004). For efficient assembly, all virion components must accumulate at the budding site, and it is believed that the viral glycoprotein accumulation determines the site of virus assembly and budding (Nayak, 2004). M1 is thought to be the bridge between the envelope glycoproteins and the RNPs for assembly (Schmitt, 2004).

2006	8	binds	BAMBI (BMP and activin membrane-bound inhibitor) is a transmembrane protein closely related to TGF-beta family receptors type I, but without serine/threonine kinase activity. In Xenopus, BAMBI expression is regulated by BMP4. BAMBI interferes with BMP, activin and TGF-beta receptor complex signaling. BAMBI binds various TGF-beta type I receptors, showing the highest affinity for TGFBR1. BAMBI can also bind TGFBR2 and activin receptor type II (Onichtchouk et al. 1999). BAMBI binds SMAD7, and this interaction involves MH1 and MH2 domains of SMAD7 and the intracellular domain of BAMBI. BAMBI and SMAD7 cooperate in the repression of TGF-beta receptor complex signaling, but BAMBI-mediated recruitment of SMAD7 to activated TGF-beta receptor complex, as BAMBI preferentially binds activated TGFBR1, does not lead to TGFBR1 degradation (Yan et al. 2009). BAMBI may downregulate TGF-beta receptor complex signaling by replacing one TGFBR1 molecule in the TGF-beta receptor heterotetramer (Onichtchouk et al. 1999). Alternatively, BAMBI-mediated recruitment of SMAD7 may compete with binding of SMAD2 and SMAD3 (R-SMADs) to the activated TGF-beta receptor complex, thus interfering with the activation of R-SMADs (Yan et al. 2009).

2008	8	binds	Ezrin is a member of the ezrin/radixin/moesin (ERM) family that acts as a linker between the plasma membrane and the actin cytoskeleton. Ezrin exists in a dormant, monomeric form in which its FERM/NERMAD and C-ERMAD domains are associated, masking membrane and F-actin binding regions. On production of PIP2, ezrin binds it, is recruited to the plasma membrane, and undergoes conformational changes unmasking the two binding sites.	PIP2;Ezrin

TLR2 or 4 associates with Mal(TIRAP) on the cell surface, which in turn facilitates the binding of MyD88 to the activated TLR, leading to NF-kB and MAPK activation [Nunez Miguel R et al 2007, Nagpal K et al 2009].

2013	8	binds	VANGL2 is a core PCP protein. In Drosophila, asymmetric localization of Stbm (the fly VANGL homologue) and Fz to opposite membranes is a hallmark of the establishment of planar cell polarity (reviewed in Maung and Jenny, 2011). In the mouse inner-ear sensory hair cells, VANGL2 is also asymmetrically distributed in the membrane (Montcouquiol et al, 2003, 2006), and this distribution depends on a direct interaction with SCRIB, a peripheral membrane protein with no known role in fly PCP (reviewed in May-Simera and Kelley, 2012). Asymmetric VANGL2 localization in the mouse inner ear also depends on CELSR1, homologue to the Drosophila core PCP protein Flamingo, however a direct interaction between VANGL2 and CELSR1 has not been demonstrated (Montcouquiol et al, 2006).

2013	8	binds	RSPO1-4 increase the levels of FZD and LRP6 receptors and decrease the amount of ZNRF3 at the plasma membrane. RSPO-induced internalization of ZNRF3 depends on LGR and the ubiquitin ligase activity of ZNRF3, and RSPO has been shown to bind directly to the extracellular region of ZNRF3 in an LGR-independent manner. These data are consistent with a model where RSPO promotes an interaction between ZNRF3 and LGR proteins that is required for downregulation of the ubiquitin ligase. In support of this model, artificial dimerization of ZNRF3 and LGR bypasses the requirement for RSPO in ZNRF3 internalization (Hao et al, 2012).	LGR__RSPO;RNF43__ZNRF3
2008	8	binds	CXCR3 (Loetscher M et al, 1996) is predominantly expressed on T lymphocytes, and on other lymphocytes (some B cells and NK cells). It is highly induced following cell activation. There are three isoforms, CXCR3-A, CXCR3-B and CXCR3-alt. CXCR3 binds to three highly related ligands in mammals, CXCL9, CXCL10 and CXCL11 (Xanthou G et al, 2003). The ligands then elicit their chemoattractant functions. CXCL9 (CMK; monokine induced by gamma-interferon, MIG; SCYB9) is a T cell chemoattractant (Farber JM, 1993). CXCL10 (IP-10) (Booth V et al, 2002) is secreted by monocytes, endothelial cells and fibroblasts in response to gamma-interferon. It can act as a chemoattractant for monocytes, macrophages, T cells, NK cells and dendritic cells, promote T cell adhesion to endothelial cells and inhibit angiogenesis and bone marrow colony formation. CXCL11 (I-TAC,; iIP-9) (Cole KE et al, 1998) is highly expressed in peripheral blood leukocytes, pancreas and liver. It is regulated by interferon and has potent chemoattractant activity for interleukin-2-activated T cells.	CXCL11__CXCL9__CXCL10;CXCR3

In the second step, the catalytic cystine in the E1 attacks the ubiquitin-adenylate (Ub-AMP) to form the activated ubiquitin-E1 thioester-bonded complex and an AMP leaving group.

2010	8	binds	The Crk adapter protein family is comprised of Crk-I and Crk-II, alternatively spliced products of a single gene with differing biological functions, and Crk-L, a distinct Crk-like gene product. Cbl is the dominant phosphoprotein associated with Crk in activated lymphocytes. In vitro binding indicates that the Crk SH2 domain binds Y774 of Cbl (Reedquist et al. 1996), leaving the SH3 domain of Crk free to interact with other SH3 domain-associated proteins.

2009	8	binds	The association of PARVA with TESK1 appears to suppress cell spreading (Lalonde et al. 2005). TESK1 can phosphorylate cofilin and promote F-actin polymerization and cell spreading (Tsumura et al., 2005 ; Toshima et al., 2001; Leeksma et al., 2002). PARVA associates with testicular protein kinase 1 (TESK1) and inhibits its activity (Lalonde et al. 2005).	PARVA;TESK1

2012	8	binds	As inferred from mouse, GLUT4 (SLC2A4) initially translocates from endosomes to insulin-responsive vesicles (IRVs, GSVs). RAB11 appears to play a role in this process. IRVs bearing GLUT4 are then translocated across the cortical actin network to the plasma membrane. Myosins 2A, 2B, 5A, and 5B contribute to translocation and are presumed to be involved in this step. Myosin 1C appears to act close to the plasma membrane and may facilitate fusion of the vesicle with the plasma membrane. RAB:GTP complexes coupled to the vesicles may interact with myosins to regulate their activity.	f-actin (ADP);EXOC3__EXOC4__EXOC7__EXOC1__EXOC2__EXOC6__EXOC8__EXOC5
2008	8	binds	CXCR6 (formerly called STRL33, BONZO, and TYMSTR) was assigned this name based on its chromosomal location (within the chemokine receptor cluster on human chromosome 3p21) and its similarity to other chemokine receptors in its gene sequence (Liao F et al, 1997). CXCR6 is structurally more closely related to CC chemokine receptors than to other CXC chemokine receptors. It is expressed in lymphoid tissues and activated T cells and is induced in activated peripheral blood lymphocytes. CXCR6 binds the ligand CXCL16 (Shimaoka T et al, 2000) which acts as a scavenger receptor on macrophages. It specifically binds to oxidized low density lipoprotein, suggesting that it may be involved in pathophysiology such as atherogenesis.	CXCR6;CXCL16

2009	8	binds	Tyrosine phosphorylateion is believed to be a general activation mechansim for the Vav family. VAV1 Tyr-174 binds to the Dbl homology region, inhibiting GEF activity. Phosphorylation of this residue by Syk relieves inhibition, activating Vav1. In Jurkat cells T-cell receptor activation leads to increased Vav2 tyrosine phosphorylation; the expression of Lck, Fyn, Zap70, or Syk stimulated this phosphorylation. Vav is regulated downstream of the thrombin and thrombopoietin receptors (Miyakawa et al. 1997) and integrins, including the major platelet integrin alphaIIbbeta3. Vav family proteins are involved in filopodia and lamellipodia formation; mouse platelets deficient in Vav1 and Vav3 exhibit reduced filopodia and lamellipodia formation during spreading on fibrinogen. This is accompanied by reduced alphaIIbbeta3-mediated PLCgamma2 tyrosine phosphorylation and reduced Ca(2+) mobilization (Pearce et al. 2007).	VAV1;Syk

Vav1 and Tec were seen to associate into a complex with the activated prolactin receptor (Kline et al. 2001). These reports were interpreted as Tec enhancing Vav GEF activity, but it has been suggested that Vav might contribute to Tec activation in T cell signaling (Reynolds et al. 2002). Tec kinases generally require PI3K-dependent membrane translocation and phosphorylation of the kinase domain, often by an Src family kinase, for activation (Takesono et al. 2002).	VAV1;TEC

2010	8	binds	NF-kappa-B essential modulator (NEMO, also known as IKKG abbreviated from Inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B kinase subunit gamma) is the regulatory subunit of the IKK complex which phosphorylates inhibitors of NF-kappa-B leading to dissociation of the inhibitor/NF-kappa-B complex. NEMO binds to K63-pUb chains (Ea et al. 2006; Wu et al. 2006), linking K63-pUb-hp-IRAK1 with the IKK complex. Models of IL-1R dependent activation of NF-kappaB suggest that the polyubiquitination of both TRAF6 and IRAK1 within a TRAF6:IRAK1 complex and their subsequent interactions with the TAK1 complex and IKK complex respectively brings these complexes into proximity, facilitating the TAK1-catalyzed activation of IKK (Moynagh, 2008).

2008	8	binds	Somatostatin (growth hormone inhibiting hormone, GHIH; somatotropin release-inhibiting factor, SRIF) (Shen LP et al, 1992) is a peptide hormone that regulates the endocrine system and affects neurotransmission and cell proliferation via interaction with somatostatin receptors 1-5 (Hoyer D et al, 1995). Somatostatin has two active forms produced by alternative cleavage of the single preproprotein and named according to the number of amino acids in the chain; Somatostatin-28 and somatostatin-14. The 5 receptors known to date all couple with pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins to inhibit adenylate cyclase after ligand binding. They were classified according to the dates they were discovered; SSTR1 and 2 (Yamada Y et al, Jan. 1992), SSTR3 (Yamada Y et al, Dec. 1992) and SSTR4 and SSTR5 (Yamada Y et al, Sep. 1993).

2008	8	binds	CXCL12 (stromal cell-derived factor-1, SDF-1) (Shirozu M et al, 1995) is produced in two forms, CXCL12alpha and CXCL12beta, by alternate splicing of the same gene (De La Luz Sierra M et al, 2004). It is a chemoattractant for T-lymphocytes and monocytes, but not neutrophils. In adult humans it plays an important role in angiogenesis by recruiting endothelial progenitor cells from the bone morrow through a CXCR4-dependent mechanism. CXCR4 (fusin) (Herzog H et al, 1993) is the receptor for CXCL12 and, like CCR5, is utilized by HIV-1 to gain entry into target cells. This receptor has a wide cellular distribution, with expression on most immature and mature hematopoietic cell types and also on vascular endothelial cells and neuronal/nerve cells. CXCR7 (RDC-1) (Infantino S et al, 2006) is expressed in monocytes, basophils and B cells and was originally an orphan receptor.	CXCR4__CXCR7;CXCL12

The cytoplasmic domain of CD226 contains binding motifs for members of the band 4.1 family of proteins, and for members of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase homolog (MAGUK) family. These proteins connect the CD226 receptor to the cytoskeleton and may promote clustering with LFA-1 integrin (also discussed in this pathway), which is known to participate in CD226's signaling cascade. CD226 plays a role in transendothelial migration, where it facilitates adherence to endothelial cells and migration between cell junctions. <p><p>Nectin-2 binds CD226. It is ubiquitously expressed in cells of various tissues, especially in epithelial cells, neurons and fibroblasts.

2006	8	binds	ATR kinase activity is stimulated upon binding of the ATR-ATRIP complex to an RPA-ssDNA complex. ATR can subsequently phosphorylate and activate the checkpoint kinase Chk1, allowing further amplification of the checkpoint signal. The ATR and Chk1 kinases then modify a variety of factors that can lead to stabilization of stalled DNA replication forks, inhibition of origin firing, inhibition of cell cycle progression, mobilization of DNA repair factors, and induction of apoptosis. This checkpoint signaling mechanism is highly conserved in eukaryotes, and homologues of ATR and ATRIP are found in such organisms as S. cerevisiae (Mec1 and Ddc2, respectively), S. pombe (rad3 and rad26, respectively), and X. laevis (Xatr and Xatrip, respectively).<p>The ATR (ATM- and rad3-related) kinase is an essential checkpoint factor in human cells. In response to replication stress (i.e., stresses that cause replication fork stalling) or ultraviolet radiation, ATR becomes active and phosphorylates numerous factors involved in the checkpoint response including the checkpoint kinase Chk1. ATR is invariably associated with ATRIP (ATR-interacting protein) in human cells. Depletion of ATRIP by siRNA causes a loss of ATR protein without affecting ATR mRNA levels indicating that complex formation stabilizes the ATR protein. ATRIP is also a substrate for the ATR kinase, but modification of ATRIP does not significantly regulate the recruitment of ATR-ATRIP to sites of damage, the activation of Chk1, or the modification of p53.<p>While the ATR-ATRIP complex binds only poorly to RPA complexed with ssDNA lengths of 30 or 50 nt, binding is significantly enhanced in the presence of a 75 nt ssDNA molecule. Complex formation is primarily mediated by physical interaction between ATRIP and RPA. Multiple elements within the ATRIP molecule can bind to the RPA-ssDNA complex, including residues 1-107 (highest affinity), 218-390, and 390-791 (lowest affinity). Although the full-length ATRIP is unable to bind ssDNA, an internal region (108-390) can weakly bind ssDNA when present in rabbit reticulocyte lysates. ATR can bind to the ssDNA directly independent of RPA, but this binding is inhibited by ATRIP. Upon binding, the ATR kinase becomes activated and can directly phosphorylate substrates such as Rad17.

CXXC4 competes with AXIN for DVL binding, and expression of CXXC4 abrogates the expression of a WNT-dependent reporter gene in L cells (Hino et al, 2001). In Xenopus, the CXXC4 homologue is expressed in neural tissue during and after the neurula stage and is required for anterior neural development (Michiue et al, 2004).	DVL3__DVL1__DVL2;IDAX
2014	8	binds	Cxxc4 was identified as Idax in a two-hybrid screen of a rat library with a human DVL1 bait. Idax forms a complex with DVL in vivo and competes with AXIN for DVL binding. Expression of Idax in L-cells abrogates the WNT3a-induced expression of a TCF-dependent reporter gene, supporting a role for Idax as a negative regulator of WNT target gene expression (Hino et al, 2001).

2012	8	binds	Elastin, the highly insoluble core protein of elastic fibers, is secreted as a soluble protein monomer referred to as tropoelastin. Under physiological conditions the monomers phase separate and coalesce into spherical packages (Clarke et al. 2006), a process known as coacervation. Packages of accumulated elastin are delivered to fibrillin-based fibres in a mechanism that is correlated with cell migration during embryonic development (Czirok et al. 2006). A transglutaminase cross-link between domain 4 of tropoelastin and domain 16 of fibrillin-1 (FBN1) may stabilize initial deposition (Clarke et al. 2005). Elastin is subsequently cross linked by members of the lysyl oxidase family via lysine residues, resulting in mature, insoluble fibres (Sato et al. 2007, Wise & Weiss 2009).<br><br>Fibulin-5 (FBLN5) expressed by vascular smooth muscle cells plays an essential role in the formation of elastic fibres, mediating interactions between elastin and fibrillin (Yanigasawa et al. 2002, Freeman et al. 2005). FBLN5 binds tropoelastin but not mature elastin (Zheng et al. 2007), regulating coacervation (Yanigasawa et al. 2009). FBLN5 can bind FBN1 monomers and fibrils (Freeman et al. 2005), but it is not clear whether this is necessary for elastin polymerization. FBLN5 also binds elastin cross-linking enzymes lysyl oxidase like (LOXL)-1, -2, and -4 (Hirai et al. 2007). Overexpression of Fbln5 increases elastin deposition and formation of desmosine cross-links (Nonaka et al. 2009). EMILIN can affect the process of elastic fibre formation (Bressan et al. 1993). It binds elastin and fibulin-5 and appears to coordinate their common interaction (Zanetti et al. 2004).	Fibrillin 1,2,(3)__MFAP2, MFAP5;FBLN5

2012	8	binds	Endorepellin is the C-terminal domain V of perlecan, constituting amino acids 36874391 (Mongiat et al. 2004). It has anti-angiogenic properties, blocking endothelial cell adhesion to fibronectin and type I collagen (Mongiat et al. 2003). Endorepellin and a smaller fragement constituting the third laminin Glike (LG) domain (LG3) disrupts actin stress fibers and focal adhesions via an interaction with the collagen receptor alpha2beta1 integrin (Bix et al. 2004). Laminin G domains 1 and 2 of endorepellin bind specifically and with high affinity to Ig domains 35 of VEGFR2 (Willis et al. 2013).	Endorepellin;GPIa__ITGB1
2013	8	binds	Once tethered at WNT promoters, beta-catenin is a scaffold for the recruitment of a variety of transcriptional activators. The C-terminal end of beta-catenin interacts with a wide range of general transcriptional activators and chromatin remodelers, while the N-terminal region recruits more WNT-specific activators including BCL9 and Pygopus (reviewed in Jessen et al, 2008). BCL9 proteins (2 in vertebrates, BCL9 and BCL9L) interact with both beta-catenin and the putative activator Pygo (also 2 in vertebrates, Pygo1 and Pygo2) and in this way function as a bridging molecule to promote WNT-dependent transcription (reviewed in Valenta et al, 2012).<br>BCL9 was identified as the gene overexpressed in a B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line (Willis et al, 1998) and was subsequently found to be homologous to Legless (Lgs), a Drosophila gene identified in a number of screens for components of the WNT signalling pathway (Kramps et al, 2002; Belenkaya et al, 2002; Thompson et al, 2002). Lgs and BCL9 have no recognizable protein motifs and share sequence similarity only in three short stretches of 30 amino acids termed homology domains (HD) 1-3 (Kramps et al, 2002; reviewed in Valenta et al, 2012). HD1 mediates the interaction with the N-terminal ARM domain of beta-catenin while HD2 is required for the recruitment of Pygo through its C-terminal plant homology domain (PHD) (Kramps et al, 2002; Sampietro et al, 2006, Sierra et al, 2006). Replacement of the PHD domain of Pygo with the beta-catenin-interacting HD2 domain of Lgs rescues the phenotype of both lgs and pygo deletion in Drosophila suggesting that the primary role of Lgs is the recruitment of Pygo (Kramps et al, 2002). Transcriptional activation by Pygo depends on the conserved tripeptide NPF in the N-terminal homology domain (NHD) (Kramps et al, 2002; Hoffmans and Basler, 2004; Hoffmans et al, 2005; Städeli and Basler, 2005).<br>In Drosophila, Lgs is essential for Wg signalling, and deletion of either Lgs or Pygo phenocopies armadillo (the Drosophila beta-catenin homologue) null mutants (Kramps et al, 2002; Thompson et al, 2002). In mammals, the requirement and roles for BCL9 and Pygo are both less strict and less completely understood. Unlike in Drosophila, disruption of the BCL9/Pygo branch in mammals has less impact on transcriptional activation than abrogation of beta-catenin-dependent signalling through the C-terminal tail (Valenta et al, 2011). Ablation of pygopus genes in mice does not phenocopy with loss of Wnt signaling (Song et al, 2007; Schwab et al, 2007; Li et al, 2007), and disruption of the BCL9/BCL9L beta-catenin interaction results in embryonic lethality three days later than in the case of complete disruption of beta-catenin-dependent transcription (Valenta et al, 2011). Mammalian BCL9 also has Pygo-independent roles in WNT signaling and has been shown to interact directly with other transcriptional co-activators such as CBP/p300 or TRRAP/GCN5 through its C-terminus (Sustmann et al, 2008). Finally, the PHD of Pygo is able to bind methylated histones, which may contribute to context-specific roles of the protein (Gu et al, 2009; Fielder et al, 2008; Kessler et al, 2009; Gu et al, 2012).

2012	8	binds	Type IV collagen (Yurchenco & Furthmayr 1984) and laminin (Yurchenco et al. 1985,1992, Cheng et al. 1997) can self-assemble in vitro, forming lattice-like polymeric networks which resemble laminin-collagen matrices observed in vivo (Timpl & Brown 1996). Purified laminins are the only basement membrane component able to assemble on cell surfaces in the absence of other components (McKee et al. 2007). Laminin knockouts prevent basement membrane assembly, arresting development at a much earlier stage than knockouts of other ECM components such as collagen IV, nidogens (entactin), perlecan or agrin (Yurchenko et al. 2004). This suggests a regulatory function for the laminin network. Laminin molecules bind to each other in a three-way interaction involving the LN domains located at the end of the three short arms. Each interaction involves one each of alpha, beta and gamma laminin subunits (Yurchenko & Cheng 1993, McKee et al. 2007) forming a polygonal structure (Yurchenko et al. 1992). <br><br>In the basement membrane collagen type IV and laminin are found in an approximately 1:1 molar ratio (Kleinman et al. 1986). Binding between laminin and collagen type IV is primarily facilitated by nidogen (Aumailley et al. 1989, Fox et al. 1991), but direct binding has been observed (Charonis et al. 1985, Rao et al. 1985). Laminin-111 (laminin-1) binds to type IV collagen through its short arms (Laurie et al. 1986).

Together with the Mef2 proteins and E proteins, MyoD transcription factors are responsible for coordinating muscle-specific gene expression in the undifferentiated myoblast. MyoD activation leads to expression of myogenin, M-cadherin, myosin heavy and light chains, and muscle creatine kinase.	MEF2B__phospho-MEF2A__MEF2D__phoshpo MEF2C;MRFs__phospho-E proteins
2008	8	binds	CX3CL1 (fractalkine) is a member of the chemokine superfamily and functions as a human leukocyte chemoattractant protein (Bazan JF et al, 1997). Unlike other human chemokines, the chemokine domain of fractalkine has three amino acids between two conserved cysteines, referred to as the CX3C motif. This molecule can exist in two forms: either membrane-anchored or as a shed 95K glycoprotein. The soluble form has potent chemoattractant activity for T-cells and monocytes, and the membrane-bound protein, which is induced on activated primary endothelial cells, promotes strong adhesion of those leukocytes. The seven-transmembrane high-affinity receptor for fractalkine, termed CX3C1, mediates both the adhesive and migratory functions of fractalkine (Imai T et al, 1997).	CX3CL1;CX3CR1

2011	8	binds	Mammalian UNC93B1, a multi-transmembrane protein, directly associates with transmembrane domains of TLR3, TLR7, TLR8 and TLR9 (and mouse TLR13) in the ER and facilitates their translocation to endolysosome compartments (Brinkmann et al 2007; Kim et al 2008; Itoh H et al 2011). Mutant mouse and human cells that lack functional UNC93B1 showed disrupted signaling via the endosomal TLRs (Taneda K et al 2006; Fukui et al 2009; Kim YM et al 2008; Qi R et al 2010; Koehn J et al 2007). Furthermore, defects in the human gene encoding UNC93B1 are associated with the increased susceptibility to herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE) in children (Casrouge A et al 2006).<p>TLR7 and TLR9 compete for UNC931-dependent trafficking and under normal circumstances TLR9 predominates over TLR7. This preference for TLR9 is mediated by an N-terminal domain in UNC93B1 and is reversed to TLR7 if UNC93B1 loses the preferential N-terminal binding site via mutation of aspartate at position 34. Loss of binding to TLR9 and preferential association with TLR7 resulted in hyperresponsiveness to RNA ligands (Fukui et al 2009).<p>TLR3 appears to translocate to the endosomal compartment with equal efficiency regardless of the presence or absence of the N-terminal domain that mediates preference for TLR9. Thus, endosomal TLR trafficking is orchestrated by UNC93B1 which determines how efficiently each TLR is able to move from the ER to the endolysosomes to initiate host responses.

2010	8	binds	The highly conserved Wnt signaling proteins play critical roles in guiding pattern formation, cell fate decision, and morphogenetic movement during animal development. They bind to the Frizzled (FZD) family of seven-pass transmembrane proteins and initiate at least three different intracellular signaling pathways. Historically they were considered to be family B GPCRs but more recent phylogenetic classifications put them into a class of their own (e.g. Schioth & Fredriksson 2005). FZD members have been demonstrated to signal via Gi/o (Slusarski et al. 1997) but this is not considered to be the primary signaling mechanism for these receptors (Hsieh 2004). Instead they signal through the canonical/beta-catenin pathway, the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway and the Wnt/Ca2+ pathway. The canonical/beta-catenin pathway requires a co-receptor protein known as LDL5 or LDL6 (Tamai et al. 2000). <br>Most Wnt signaling has been attributed to the activation of FZD receptors but there is evidence of FZD-independent signaling (Mikels & Nusse 2006). Much Wnt research has used indirect evidence to infer the involvement of FZD receptors (e.g. Gazit et al. 1999) but there is some direct evidence of Wnt-FZD binding (Hsieh et al. 1999; Mikels & Nusse 2006).

KIF7 is required for the processing and activity of GLI in the absence of Hh signal, and KIF7 function depends on the primary cilium (Liem et al, 2009; Cheung et al, 2009; Endoh-Yamagami et al, 2009). KIF7 has been shown to bind to GLI3 and to SUFU and may act in part by promoting the transit of the GLI:SUFU complex through the primary cilium, which is required for GLI processing (Endoh-Yamagami et al, 2009; Maurya et al, 2013). How KIF7 itself is localized to the cilia tip is unknown, although localization depends on the KIF7 motor domain (Liem et al, 2009; He et al, 2014). KIF7 localization is further enhanced at the primary cilia tip in response to Hh signaling, as is also the case for GLI2, GLI3 and SUFU (He et al, 2014; Varjosalo et al, 2008; Haycraft et al, 2005; Wen et al, 2010; Qin et al, 2011; Tukachinsky et al, 2010).	microtubule;KIF7

2011	8	binds	The minimal functional NOTCH coactivator complex that activates transcription from NOTCH regulatory elements is a heterotrimer composed of MAML (mastermind-like), NICD (NOTCH intracellular domain) and RBPJ (CSL) (Fryer et al. 2002). Structural studies indicate that NOTCH:RBPJ complexes can be pre-assembled on promoters of NOTCH-target genes and that MAML binds to a composite groove created by RBPJ and the NOTCH ankyrin domain (Nam et al. 2006). MAML is able to interact directly with a histone acetyltransferases EP300 (p300) and CREBBP. The presence of EP300 strongly activates NOTCH1 coactivator complex-mediated transcription and this positive effect is blocked by Lys-CoA, a selective inhibitor of EP300 histone acetyltransferase activity (Fryer et al. 2002). NICD1:RBPJ:MAML-mediated transcription increases threefold in the presence of both EP300 and PCAF, in comparison with the presence of EP300 alone (Wallberg et al. 2002).

Melanopsin is expressed only in the retina and there, only in 1-2% of the ganglion cells.

2012	8	binds	Ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase UCHL5 (UCH37) deubiquitinates TGFBR1, stabilizing TGF-beta receptor complex and prolonging TGF-beta receptor signaling.

2009	8	binds	Sema5s have been implicated in invasive growth, vascular patterning and axon guidance. Plexin-B3 is the specific and high-affinity receptor for Sema5A, and their interaction triggers the collapsing response.	SEMA5A;PLXNB3
2013	8	binds	Biglycan (BGN) is a member of the small leucine-rich repeat proteoglycan family (SLRPs) which also includes decorin, fibromodulin (Hedlund et al. 1994 - binding to collagen II), lumican and asporin (Hedbom & Heinegard 1993, Ezura et al. 2000). All appear to be involved in collagen fibril formation and matrix assembly (Ameye & Young 2002). <br><br>BGN-deficient mice exhibit larger and irregular fibrils leading to thin dermis and reduced bone mass (Corsi et al. 2002, Xu et al. 1998). BGN binds collagen types I (Schönherr et al. 1995), II (Bovine, using pig BGN - Vynios et al. 2001, Bovine, using bovine BGN - Douglas et al. 2008), III (Bovine, using bovine BGN - Douglas et al. 2008), VI (Wiberg et al. 2001) and IX (Chen et al. 2006 - species source of collagen/BGN unknown).

2012	8	binds	As inferred from mouse adipocytes, insulin signals via PKC-lambda to cause Rab4 to load GTP and associate with Kif3, which then has higher affinity for microtubules. Motor activity of Kif3 along microtubules is believed to transport vesicles containing Glut4 (Slc2a4) across the cytosol to the cortical actin network.	KIF3A__KIFAP3__KIF3B;GTP__RAB4A
2004	8	binds	XPC is mutated in individuals with xeroderma pigmentosum from genetic Complementation Group C (XP-C). It forms a tight heterodimeric complex with human Rad 23B homolog, HR23B and is thought to bind to the damaged site with lesion first triggering subsequent reactions<BR>	P58;XPC

Inhibition of PP2A-PPP2R2D phosphatase activity allows mitotis entry and mainetance by preventing dephosphorylation of CDK1 mitotic targets (Mochida et al. 2010, Gharbi-Ayachi et al. 2010).	p-ARPP19__p-S67-ENSA;PP2A-subunit A__PPP2R2D__PP2A-catalytic subunit C
2008	8	binds	CHL1 accumulates in the presynaptic plasma membrane and it recruits heat shock cognate 71 kDa protein (HSP7C/HSC70), in an ADP dependent manner. HSC70 interacts with the intracellular domain of CHL1. Upon synapse activation, CHL1 along with HSC70 is endocytosed and is targeted to synaptic vesicles (SVs). In synapses, HSC70 regulates uncoating of synaptic vesicles (SVs) in the clathrin-dependent recycling pathway (Leshchyns'ka et al. 2006, Zinsmaier & Bronk 2001).	CHL1;ADP
2010	8	binds	Ubiquitin E3 ligases confer specificity to ubiquitination by recognizing target substrates and mediating transfer of ubiquitin from an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme to substrate (Raymond et al. 2009). E3 ligases includes a large, diverse set of proteins characterized by several defining motifs which include a HECT (homologous to E6-associated C-terminus), RING (Really Interesting New Gene) and U-box domains. The E3 ligases can be multisubunit complexes rather than a single polypeptide. Presently three different kinds of E3 complexes have been described called SCF, APC, and VHL. E3 ligases binds to both substrate and an E2 thioesterified with ubiquitin (E2-Ub).

2009	8	increases	The transcription factors PDX-1 and PAX6 binds the promoter of the human GIP gene between 145 and 184 nucleotides upstream of the start of transcription and enhance transcription of GIP. In mouse Pdx-1 also increases the number of GIP-producing K cells. Consensus binding sites for other transcription factors such as AP-1, AP-2, and Sp1 have been identified in the promoter of the GIP gene but their role is unknown. The human GIP promoter is responsive to cAMP by an unknown mechanism.	GATA4;GIP

Homeobox protein NKX-2.5 (NKX2-5), in cooperation with transcription factor GATA-4 (GATA4) and interacting partners homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 1 and 2 (HIPK1 and 2), acts as a transcriptional activator factor of NPPA in mice (Lee et al. 1998).

2009	8	increases	TCF-4 and Beta-Catenin form a heterodimer that bind the G2 element of the promoter of the Proglucagon (GCG) gene in L2 cells of the intestine. CDX-2 binds an AT-rich sequence in the G1 enhancer element of the GCG promoter. Transcription of the GCG gene is enhanced by cAMP, calcium, and insulin and the Beta-Catenin:TCF-4 binding region of the promoter is necessary for this regulation. It is therefore postulated that the Wnt signaling pathway (Beta-Catenin) crosstalks with the cAMP-PKA pathway and/or the cAMP-EPAC pathway.	PAX6;GLUC
